movies,Red One (Amazon Christmas movie) giving me horror movie vibes ,"Went in expecting a big budget Christmas movie rife with special effects and was not disappointed. Surface level chicanery, some cool re-imaginings of classic content. I also thought it was a movie for children…it’s not. What surprised me was the numerous style and tone choices that would be right at home in a classic horror movie. Plus some truly eerie (excellent) creature makeup work. I don’t have kids but I can’t imagine showing this to a child: if I had seen it at a young age several parts would have been truly terrifying.

movies,City of Angels (1998) and correcting a 25 year injustice. ,"This will be kind of  rant but its story time.

When the movie City of Angels came out in 1998 it also had the song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls came out.  This was in the era of MTV still airing music videos and 10 year old me really liked the one for Iris. 

I figured out that it was on the soundtrack for this movie so I tried to rent it at the local movie store, Blockbuster had not yet made it to my town and this was a small mom and pop shop run by a family. 

When they saw the 10 year old boy me trying to rent City of Angels, the guy decided that I would not like this movie and I should rent something else instead.  At the counter he swapped it out for some C tier action flick i dont remember and my mom didn't really seem to care about this. 

So I never got to see it. Years passed and I forgot the title, but occasionally I'd hear that song Iris and remember that there was a movie out there somewhere that I was denied. 

It haunted me. 

25 years later. My fiancee and I are talking about songs we want to play at our wedding.  He turns on the song Iris. This set me on the quest. I could not get past this unforgivable betrayal of a movie I never got to see. 

Finally. I got it. And we are now about to correct a 25 year wrong. 

This got me thinking and I want to ask

movies,Is it so incredibly difficult to not talk in a movie theatre!,"I just saw Wicked in theatres for the first time and thought it was a great watch, but the people in the theater almost ruined it. I didn’t have one of the cases of people singing thankfully, but even that would have been better. I go to the movies once or twice a month, and surely enough every time there’s people who can’t shut their mouths. A comment or two is fine, I’ll lean over to my friend and whisper if I need to, but having entire conversations is absurd. Sometimes people in the back will legitimately have conversations at full volume! I like sitting in the back because it gives me a headache to be super close to the screen, so I guess it’s on me a bit when people around me talk. With that said, I go to a lot of relatively small theatre rooms and I bet anyone could hear it with the volume they’re at. I hate feeling like the asshole when it comes to telling people to be quiet, but sometimes it just comes to that. Today I had to (politely) shush someone and she kind of just scoffed and laughed it off. Later when I left she gave me and the person I was with a totally nasty expression. Like, I’m sorry but how am I the asshole here. I can’t remember if it was always like this, but I feel like it’s gotten worse since streaming had gotten popular and people are used to watching in their homes. I’d honestly rather people just shout things out a few times and be annoying like that rather than full hushed conversations throughout the whole movie.

movies,Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?,"Question, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

I must admit, I've been going on a binge on Warren Beatty films recently and I still can't believe he has done only 23 films. and having done a post before, he has turned down a lot of roles and had some unrealized projects. Looking at his filmography, he was productive from 1961-1975, but after that he became more inconsistent with his projects, pretty much taking years before he does one.

From what I read, Beatty was a bit of a perfectionist and to the detriment of the crew, who takes his time and was go multitude of takes.

I will say, I think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Reds, &amp; Bulworth are masterpieces, and Dick Tracy is fun. However, he is also notable for some real stinkers, Ishtar is middling but it really tanked his image. Town &amp; Country is bad and it pretty much put him into exile and Rules Don't Apply, his comeback, reaffirmed that exile.

Overall, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

movies,Neil Breen's Influence on Megalopolis,"Did Neil Breen have an influence on the script for Megalopolis, direct or indirect?

To clarify what I mean, I highlight a number of similarities between Breens work and Megalopolis:
- In Breens movies, every attractive woman wants to sleep with Breen, resulting in a romantic subplot or love triangle. In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar.
- In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar's dead wife.
- In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two.
- In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others.
- In Breens movies, the villains/antagonists are corrupt politicians and/or corrupt businessmen. In Megalopolis, the main antagonists are Mayor Cicero and the banker Crassus.

I'm not claiming that Neil Breen wrote the script to Megalopolis.

I don't know where to ask such a specific question, and whether it's more suited for a film subreddit or a historical subreddit, but I'll try anyway.

From the first minute of the movie, one shot has this breast star that Patton is wearing. It looks like [The Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown](https://www.identifymedals.com/database/medals-by-period/pre-ww1-medals/the-order-of-merit-of-the-bavarian-crown/). What makes this peculiar is that this is a royal Bavarian order that stopped being awarded after the end of WW1. It is not in the list of awards Patton received nor is Patton in the list of recipients of this award anywhere. Did the film make a mistake here and just put any old decoration? It seems like an odd mistake when they got all his other decorations perfectly correct, and why would they just randomly have this specific royal Bavarian order to put on?",cheese_bruh,1hf5frc,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf5frc/pattons_decorations_in_patton_1970/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf5frc/pattons_decorations_in_patton_1970/,2024-12-15 23:28:39,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fBAR_s5hyciOOQ0rpj5zaKrmn28QVJROJE6VOSE1bKg.jpg,t3_1hf5frc

movies,The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull opening is one of the weirdest things ever,"Never been a fan of Indiana Jones, didn't grow up on his movies, seen only the first one on TV at some points. Started watching them in order and just finished The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.

So this is the grand return of the character to the big screen and Harrison Ford's return to the role. Indiana Jones always struck me as a less cliched action hero. Sure, there's a pulpy feel to his adventures and they're generally pretty light hearted, but he still feels less like a typical invincible soldier with a machine gun type of an action hero and more of a everyman, an archeology professor who rarely uses his gun, who's not in it for the money or glory, who often gets captured, gets hit during brawls and is afraid of snakes.

And one of the first things he does in this movie is survives a nuclear explosion. Now I've always heard about the fact that Indiana Jones hid from a nuclear explosion in a fridge, but I've thought that it was either a meme I didn't understand or a climactic moment in one of the movies. But no, this is literally happening in an opening, he randomly stumbles upon a nuclear testing site and hides in a fridge to miraculously survive. And then the movie actually starts. Like, due to the law of drama, him being fired due to red scare(isn't 1957 too late for McCarthyism?) feels more dramatic than him living through a nuclear explosion without even breaking a bone from that flying fridge.

I know that this movie is not very well liked by the fans(it is okay-ish, though the CGI is pretty cheap, the nuclear fridge is dumb and also Indy being dumbed down and trusting Mac about ""I've left you to die with the soviets, but I'm actually a double agent"" and then ignoring the fact how he openly thirsts for the treasure in the El Dorado is ridiculous). But I'm curious how did people react to this opening after seeing their favourite hero return.

In my case, #1 this year is very clearly Dune Pt2 (but who knows, maybe in 20 years I'll disagree!).

movies,The Lies (and Deaths) of Christopher Nolan,"I’ve noticed a major plot point in many of Nolan’s movies often revolve around lies and false realities being deployed either selfishly or selflessly. 

Memento is about a serial killer taking advantage of his faded memory and creating a completely false narrative in order to avoid confronting his role in the death of his wife. 

In The Prestige, there is a constant game of lies played between Angier, Borden, Olivia, and Sarah all in the name of one-upmanship and dedication. A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier’s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.

At the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public about Harvey Dent’s final moments and intentions in order to avoid a scenario where all optimism had disappeared from Gotham. This is mirrored by Alfred choosing to set Rachel’s letter on fire, hoping to avoid an even deeper heart break within Bruce who’s already grieving from her death.

A large plot point in Inception revolves around Cobb making Mal come to terms with the false world they live in, ultimately making her naturally untrustworthy of her surroundings even upon coming back to reality, leading to her (wait for it) death.

Interstellar is in large part about the lies you tell others in order to make them feel safe, such as Coop (dead wife) not being forward with the extent of his mission to his children, Coop not being forward with the extent of his role and fate in the mission over Gargantua to Brand (Hathaway), and Professor Brand (Caine) not being forward with the probability of Plan A ever working. By contrast, the supposedly brave and virtuous Dr. Mann lies about the prospects of his planet in order to save himself at the expense of humanity.

Nolan’s often known for having a fascination with time manipulation and fractured narratives and he also gets a lot of flack for overly theatrical and complicated screenplays but I find his fascination with people’s perceptions and how they either accept fake narratives or create them for others to be what really makes me appreciate him as a writer. Just an unabashed interest in the psychological that I find to be endlessly entertaining.

There was another common plot point that comes up a lot in Nolan’s movies but I can’t remember it now.

movies,"Castle in the Sky by Hayao Miyazaki, a great Japanese animation that was inspired by Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. One of my favorite animated films.","https://preview.redd.it/a4c7wxlm647e1.jpg?width=1678&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=967c5786118484fbeeb2e02ff27f82c84978ee9f

Castle in the Sky (天空の城ラピュタ), also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Laputa is an ancient civilization that once stood so imposing and grand, above all and everyone, but now lies completely deserted and in ruins, surrounded by the environment. Tree roots surround the entire castle, and the human architecture is covered in greenery, with animals and streams running through it. It is as if the natural world is reclaiming what is rightfully its own, and Miyazaki is telling the viewer that the world is not ours, and that humans only have the sense of grandeur that we get because the natural environment allows us to, and that if we are not careful, it may very well pull the rug out from under us and take back what belongs to it.

It was inspired by the book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.

Laputa is a flying island described in the 1726 book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. With an adamantine base, which its inhabitants can manoeuvre in any direction using magnetic levitation. The island is the home of the king of Balnibarbi and his court, and is used by the king to enforce his rule over the lands below.

The film is a strong critic of the use of technology for militarism and the desire for domination. The villain Muska, like Sheeta, is also a descendant of the original inhabitants of Laputa, uses the stone to open a secret gate and assumes power in the flying city. And he desires world control through the power of weapons in Laputa.

The impractical and dangerously authoritative behavior Gulliver details in describing the Laputians is often alluded to throughout Castle in the Sky as the reason for Laputa’s eventual abandonment and ruin. Considering that Miyazaki had read Gulliver’s Travels and often uses his films as a vehicle for political commentary, it would be remiss to dismiss such parallels. Whether intentional or not, Miyazaki effectively adapts warnings regarding absolute sovereignty’s control over scientific innovations to the Cold War era.

Hayao Miyazaki's films, in addition to the beautiful images, are known for criticizing militarism and defending the environment, as happened in the film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which talks about a great war that devastated humanity and the environment.

movies,"""Constant questioners"" whilst watching a movie - annoying, or no?","I was watching a movie with a friend on the weekend, and he has this IMO extremely annoying habit of constantly asking questions during the movie. Like 'why did they do that?' 'what was that for?' 'what's he planning with that' etc etc.

Suffice it to say, I find this extremely fucking annoying and I told him so in no uncertain terms. His response was to play the victim like ""Man, why so aggressive?"".

The thing is, constant questioners IMO, basically know they're being annoying and do it anyway. We're watching the same movie. We're up to the same point in the movie since we're watching it together. I don't have any knowledge of the movie you don't, unless you weren't paying attention - but even still, that is not on me to rectify for you, you need to pay attention.

And even still, he asks questions I couldn't possibly have the answer for and it's strongly implied the movie will answer them for you anyway as long as you keep watching. Like, why ask me that question when you know I don't know the answer? The movie hasn't given us the information yet but you know it will later!

Is it just me, or are constant questioners the worst people to watch movies with? I'm basically banning him from watching movies at my place now.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 5 - Finale,"Hello there,

since more than 50 days, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day (more or less, depending on which time zone you are in) and while this is not This is not quite the end (one country is still missing after this), but I can already draw a first conclusion and have to say: we had our crazy days too. There were days when I could hardly save myself from film suggestions, double nominations and debates about whether a film complied with the rules or not. And there were days when I was mentally on the verge of dropping out because it seemed impossible to find even one film. (Both times I would like to thank the respective participants).

Towards the end, things got particularly strange again in terms of participation: after I was almost criticised for counting the UK as a country and not wanting to have any geographical duplications, the participation rate in the England-thread was still very high and then really dropped. Some people even seemed to be angry that I dared to name Northern Ireland individually - that lead into a shower of downvotes. But I don't want to complain: We have found four candidates for your favorite movie set in the **United Kingdom**.

And this is how it is played: Below you will find four comments from me - these are the respective winners from the individual rounds. The winner is the film mentioned in the comment with the most upvotes (minus downvotes). You may comment on my comments, ***but please refrain from suggesting new films***. The only exception I will accept for this: If there is a UK film that could not be attributed to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, this is an opportunity to put it in the race.

I'm very excited, how this will work out - thanks a lot in advance!

P.S.: Since I'm not able to proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like,",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hewsks,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewsks/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewsks/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-15 16:56:27,0,0.4,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hewsks
movies,What Horror Movie Sub-Genres you’re not a Fan of and Why?,"Horror Movie Sub-Genres I’m not a Fan of and Why are:

Found Footage - Because of the shaky camera and a completely saturated market.

Just way too many low-effort movies in this genre. Similar plots, shaky cameras that doesn't really add anything (except in good ones), and such. The (sub)genre is just filled with too much of garbage, while it's still possible to find a gem

Body Horror 

Demon Possession - Because it’s the exact same movie. And I think a lot of them forget what's actually scary about the idea of demonic possession, which is the thought of not being able to control your own body and the threat of damnation, not just weird contortions and little girls shouting blasphemy with the voice of several grown men.

It's just getting overdone now with little to no innovation in the subgenre. Every single one pretty much feels the same and has a very similar story to tell. 

It always feels predictable, and the religious allusions made in the film are just annoying. It's one of the few horror sub-genres that I can't take seriously.

Initial encounter. Slow build up of strange behavior. Eventual blow up. Speaking in tongues and obscene language unusual for that person. Gets tied down in exorcism. Holy water. Screaming, writhing and contorting. Faith breaks through at the last minute and they're saved! Rinse, repeat. The possessed person always acts the same and the arc of the struggle always feels the same.

Home Invasion - Because a character usually has to do something beyond stupid to let the home invasion happen or they have the upper hand over the invader and don't kill them off until it's too late.",Amber_Flowers_133,1heuh6m,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,2024-12-15 15:09:25,0,0.39,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heuh6m

Because when entering the world of Coco, I felt the wonder of child-me again. I wanted the film to explore every inch of its tale, show me as many parts of its universe as possible and meet more characters to learn about their story.

It was the most innocent but still a very true and sometimes hard hitting story about the meaning of death for both sides, the living and the dead. It's pretty awesome how Pixar managed to get those very dark and adult themes told in a movie mainly aimed at a very young audience. 

Also, the movie looks beautiful. The shadows, the lights and the very strong colours make it a visually pleasing experience. What really caught me off guard was the detail on some characters. The wrinkles on Coco herself are borderline photorealistic.

movies,Swiss Family Robinson (1960) - A great adventure and is similar to the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams and Robinson Crusoe.,"Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 adventure film starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran in a tale of a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss.

The film is not a classic, it is a more naive and fun adventure. It's as if Robinson Crusoe got lost with his family on an island.

The book The Swiss Family Robinson (Der Schweizerische Robinson) is a novel by the Swiss author Johann David Wyss which was inspired by the book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and inspired the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams

The basic story is a husband and wife want to get away from the rat race and are traveling by ship from their home in Switzerland to New Guinea to start a new life. But before they arrive they are caught in a bad storm and are shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. The captain and crew must have seen it coming and deserted early, leaving the family, with three sons, to fend for themselves.

They do the best they can to salvage useful items and supplies from the wrecked ship and set about building their new home. It ends up being a quite elaborate 3-cottage cluster in a very large tree with nicely spread limbs.

The family finds a number of animals, a Tiger, a small elephant, and several others that lead them to think it might be a land bridge, so they build a small boat and set sail to try to go around the island. Another shipwreck and an encounter with a band of pirates results in their rescuing a teenage girl as her grandpa is captured.

In the end the pirates return, the Family Robinson work hard with improvised defenses to hold off the pirates and, when it seems the pirates will prevail a ship arrives and starts shooting at the pirates and their ship to save the day.

When it was all over the parents decided they wanted to stay in this ""New Switzerland"" with the prospects of additional settlers.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1hf45fa,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf45fa/swiss_family_robinson_1960_a_great_adventure_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf45fa/swiss_family_robinson_1960_a_great_adventure_and/,2024-12-15 22:27:04,5,0.65,5,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1hf45fa

movies,A Christmas Prince (2017),"I just watched this Netflix Christmas movie for the first time and it's left me with some questions. 

One, the tiny nation of Aldovia has so many orphaned children they can fill an enormous and stately orphanage. What happened a generation ago to kill all these children's parents? The statue of the late king shows him in military uniform - was he a war hero? When was the war in Aldovia?

The second bit of world building was in the climax of the movie where &gt;!the King's secret note in the acorn Christmas ornament changed the law to allow non-blood relations to still be in the royal line of succession!&lt;. Aldovia has a Prime Minister, which suggests it is a constitutional monarchy, but this plot makes it seem like the king is the head of both the executive AND legislative branches of government. The head of this nation had extraordinary, unchecked power - perhaps the result of the hinted-at civil war?

The last question is about the posh accents of the entire royal family. All of the official royal decrees and ceremonies are held in English. There's no sign of a native Aldovian language. Is Aldovia a colony of the British Empire? What happened to the Native Aldovians and their language? Could this perhaps be the seed of the conflict that led to the former king becoming a war hero, and the leagues of orphans in the care of the state?

What are the themes? At first, you would think that the script was inspired by a bad date with the annoying kind of atheist who also wouldn't let her leave the apartment. Take that kind of uncomfortable, creepy, scary experience and keep amplifying it until it turns into horror. 

  
Then there's the fact that both actresses were raised Mormon and have apparently distanced themselves from it. I read a few comments from ex-Mormons who said that the movie really resonated with them. And Mr. Reed, as horrible and dishonest as he is, does raise some points about Mormonism which are both true and troubling. I can see how a woman raised in a very conservative religious family would look at the men of her family and be reminded of Mr. Reed. In other words, I think the movie may aim to subtly subvert adherence to high demand, high control religions such as Mormonism. 

  
I'm curious about Mr. Reed's motivations, planning and methods. Why and how does he go about running this house of horror? 

  
I note that Mr. Reed lets slip the occasional weird comment like when he says ""blueberry pie"" instead of ""Lou Gehrig's disease"" in a way that might be seen as mocking her father's death but then he pulls back. What was happening there? 

  
It's the kind of movie that's full of so many subtleties in the plot and acting.

movies,Lindsay Lohan is phenomenal in The Parent Trap,"
I just watched The Parent Trap for the first time, and she seriously surprised me. She should’ve been nominated for a golden globe, at the very least.

She’s so believable as twins it’s crazy. She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which “twin” was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. 

Every single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.

There’s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they’re twins. There’s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers this line with a single tear and a voice crack, and it was fantastic. It’s so subtle, but packs a big punch. Never in a millions years, did I ever think I’d start to tear up watching The Parent Trap, of all movies…

She’s so good, and the movie seriously surprised me. I would definitely watch it again

Most of them seem divided between whether one should tip at a restaurant or not, if yes then how much, and then if the minimum is also increasing every year seemingly. 

I resonate with some of the points Mr. Pink said, like when he said he'd like to do something about it eg if there's a paper to sign or party to vote, but he seemed generally in disagreement with the society who decided who he should tip or not. 

PS. No hate or disrespect to anyone making a living off those tips, but just want to initiate a genuine conversation.

Also PS. I'm not from America, so it's not something I've seen and experienced all my life. I have been living in America for 2 years but different people have different opinions and hence I want to pick your minds too.

Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is decent and definitely a holiday classic. And I know there's a whole range of analysis about the story, the characters, the aesthetics, and what it all means. But it kind of seems to occupy its own place among Christmas movies. It has that feel good quality of a deep meaningful Christmas movie. There are some cheerful moments. But it also has this dark melancholic unsettling tone throughout it that you can't ignore. And there are definitely some weird aspects to some of the characters and things that happen.

movies,Rewatched Mad Max: Fury Road. I don’t get the hype,"I watched *Mad Max: Fury Road* about a month ago. I thought it was really cool and a good movie overall. Soon after, I checked its critic scores and was blown away by how high they were. I read up on people's opinions about it and it was just non-stop praise. Like yeah, It was good, but THAT good?! I went back and watched it again. 

I still don't get it.

OK before this gets downvoted into oblivion, I DO get why people like this movie; I like it too!! The pacing and choreography is insane, clever and subtle feminist themes, and everything done practically made for a great and more engaging viewing experience.

BUT

Is it really THAT good? I mean character development is kind of non-existent and I never really felt connected to any character or cared about what happened to them (I also never watched a Mad Max movie before, but I feel my criticism is valid), it lacked substance, and it was so abundant with and reliant on action that it never felt like the stakes were high, and scenes without action felt empty and stilted.

I understand that the movie puts less emphasis on certain aspects because it knows what it wants to be; I actually think that this kind of self-awareness in a film is rare and extremely important in putting a good project together. However, when people say that this is THE BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER MADE, I have to be harsh!

I don’t really want to argue (ok maybe a little), I want to hear from you guys on why this movie gets the praise it does and where I might be missing it.

TLDR: Everyone say movie is best movie. Me no see how movie is better than good movie.

movies,"How do you feel about fantasy franchise being turned into ""isekai"" by Hollywood?","(PORTAL FANTASY) Examples like Sonic the Hedgehog, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Barbie, A Minecraft Movie, Monster Hunter. Some people were saying there is a movie called Master of the Universe that did the same.

Is there a name for Hollywood making non-isekai movies into isekai (or whatever you wanna call the genre)?  
It's usually the fantasy world comes to Earth, or humans from Earth travel to the fantasy world.

Do you think they do it so the ""average"" cinema goer can enjoy it more, or connect to it?

How do you feel about it? As a fan, and sometimes non-fan.

Whether I like the franchise (Super Mario Bros.) or not (Minecraft), every time I see it, it makes me roll my eyes, and makes me think like it's a lazy way to approach the story.

There are some successful (box office) movies that don't do this, like Detective Pikachu, Dungeons and Dragons, Warcraft, Lord of the Rings, Resident Evil, that don't do this and people still go and watch them.  
(Haven't watched Dungeons and Dragons, and Warcraft, but based on trailers they seem 100% set in their fantasy world).

Edit:

1. I'm not looking for what the genre is called, I'm asking for your opinions on it.
2. If you don't know what I'm talking about you don't have to engage, leave this post alone.
3. Chronicles of Narnia and The Wizard of Oz are not what I am talking about. Those stories were made ""isekai"" and the movies kept it ""isekai"". I am talking about ""non-isekai"" turned into ""isekai"" to make it into a movie.
