gaming,"I quit playing PvP games, recommend me pve stuff. ","Won’t go into immense details but I quit playing PvP games due to a couple factors, I got older and have less time, i have some health issues (mainly digestive issues where I need to be able to stop at any point and in PvP games you can’t just pause), and honestly they just aren’t the same or fun for me anymore.

Recommend me some pve/pvm stuff where I can play solo, play at my own pace without having deadlines (like battle passes I need to complete, fomo content and not feeling like I’ll miss out on stuff that I’ll never be able to get again if I don’t finish it in x amount of time). And a big part is something kind of open ended where I can pause or stop whenever I need to without ruining the match for others or having to go afk leaving people down a player. 

I was thinking about palworld, or maybe monster hunter world, but does anyone have other suggestions for me for nice long soloable games?

gaming,The Souls-like genre is becoming oversaturated - agree or disagree?,"The souls-like genre has really blown up over the past 5 years or so. Before then it was mostly Fromsoft games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, etc), with a few lower quality imitators (The Surge, Lords of the Fallen, Mortal Shell, etc).

There are a lot of souls-likes now. Like, too many maybe, to the point of oversaturation. The soulslike genre is starting to feel like how the rhythm genre felt a decade ago, before it imploded on itself and died. It’s not unexpected for developers to shift towards making games in this genre, especially after Elden Ring was so successful, and it’s not even that the games themselves are low quality like before. Titles like Lies of P, Black Myth Wukong, and Thiasma are genuinely excellent games.

I think it becomes an issue of innovation and repetition. The genre seems to be nearing its peak in terms of mechanics and innovation, or at least as far as devs are willing to take it. Most games in the genre play like Dark Souls 3, a game that came out nearly a decade ago. The most innovation the genre has seen is incorporating deflects like in Sekiro and Lies of P. Even Elden Ring, which many would consider to be the peak of the genre, other than the open world, is mechanically identical to DS3. I don’t think anyone can deny that these games aren’t high quality and fantastic, but they all play very similarly, and it seems like it’s going to be difficult to advance the genre further than where it’s at. 

And yet, because the genre is successful, games are likely going to be pumped out until the genre dies. Unlike shooters or sports games, I don’t think this genre can survive long term while recycling its own mechanics and ideas over and over again. Fromsoft, who are undeniably the top of the food chain in this genre, even seem to be running out of ideas for actual gameplay innovation, and are pushing the enemies difficulty further in bizarre ways such as delayed hits, leading to controversial bosses like the final boss of the Elden Ring DLC and quite a few others from that game.

Maybe it’s burnout on my part. I’ve been playing these games for over a decade, since Demon’s Souls on PS3. I was able to see the genre advance to where it is now, and to me, it’s been stagnant for at least the last 5 years. I wasn’t even able to finish the Elden Ring DLC as it felt so samey to everything else that’s come out in the last few years, and by the time I beat the final boss, I just shelved the game and had no drive to explore the rest of the DLC or to start up a new run with the new builds introduced in the DLC, which would be unheard of just a few years ago. 

I don’t expect that this topic will be well received given how popular the genre is right now, and again, it’s not like the games coming out are bad by any means (and indeed, are routinely game of the year contenders now). But I also would not be surprised if the genre has mostly died out by 2030, particularly if innovation isn’t ramped up. But I wouldn’t even know how to suggest innovation, the genre has potentially reached a peak in that regard. Anyways, interested to see what others have to say on the subject.

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - was anyone disappointed by the game’s last act?,"So, I’ll open up by saying I really loved the game. I wasn’t expecting to like (or even play) this one, but I’m very glad that did. 

Still, I felt like the later areas lacked a lot of the polish of the first half of the game. 

&gt;! Vatican City and Gizeh were both so fun to play through. By the time I got to Siam, though, the game felt much less polished. I encountered a number of pretty rough bugs - one game breaking, most just annoying.!&lt;

Did anyone else find the number of bugs increasing in the final few zones? Did anyone else feel like those parts of the game felt less polished or more rushed?

Just curious how others felt. This was a game that was almost a 10/10 for me — and one that really surprised me mechanically, since I don’t really like any of the gameplay elements in other games/on their own — but the friction as I got later on really pulled things down.

Whether its the fact that Ubisoft likes money (gasp), the games are historically inaccurate (true), or that certain demographics are forced (that is a subjective argument that I'd like to ignore for this topic.

That being said, the settings of the previous AC's have several things in common: a land with a prolonged conflict, between classes, ethnicities or religion. Neither party has control over the whole map and fighting occurs sporadically and locally. Usually the map involves different cities and the newer games involve naval battles. You also meet up and coming scientists and philosophers and new technologies become available. That being said, I hereby present my idea:

The Netherlands during the 80 years' war 1568-1648).

Hear me out. During this period the Dutch had their ""golden age"", mastering the seas, even though they had a war of independence with Spain. The Dutch were protestant, Spain catholic, which lead to regional warfare where the occupied south practiced Catholicism and the north Protestantism. Several cities were sieged with new inventions, like the Dutch using pumps to drain water protecting the besieged cities. With regards to art, science and philosophy; Jheronimus Bosch and Leeghwater come to mind and also the fact that the VOC was founded, the first publicly owned company with a very dubious past. It was also a time when many of the amazing buildings we are still mesmerising over were being built and when ""the new world"" was still new (the Dutch founded New York in 1624).

That being said, it would help if Ubisoft would try to not make all the Dutch people speak Gernan.

gaming,Gameshow Type Couch Coop Games Suggestions,"Hi everyone!

So a few friends and I have been into playing a lot of gameshow type couch coop games, and we're looking for new ones to play. Lately we've really been into Monopoly and Wheel of Fortune on PS5, and have also dabbled in Jeopardy and Family Feud a few times. Basically, we've been really into boardgame type games lately, but not opposed to other kinds of coop games similar.

We've run out of ideas of anything new to play though, do any of you have any suggestions for good games to play coop? I have a range of system, but usually just stick with PS5 and the Steam Deck. Steam has a LOT of games too, so their library might be bigger than PS5s.

gaming,"[MEGAPOST] [City Builder, Simulators, Space RPGs] Games I'd Like To Know About","There are several niches I have that are unfulfilled, and I've spent a considerable time looking every which way but haven't found much. Maybe there are undiscovered gems you can enlighten me with?

Dystopian Builder - I know about Dystopika, and I know you can get close with heavily modded City Skylines and/or modded Prison Architect, but is there anything more concrete? Tropico kinda counts, and Frostpunk doesn't really, since it's about making life better, in a way. I wanna make 1984, be the Big Brother

Nukes and Reactors - I know about Reactor Tech2, but it's so isosteric and not purely about Nuclear Reactors. And on the topic of Nukes, I know Planetary Annihilation: TITANS, which is the best fitting title to date. ICBM and DEFCON kinda don't count, since they don't really let you get up-close and see the mushroom

Police Sims - I know about LSPDFR, Police Sim: Patrol Officers, Flashing Lights and Ready or Not, just kinda wondering if there are any more little-known gems

Space RPGs - Recently beat Outer Worlds, and I'm sorta torn if I should play Starfield. Ik Starsector, might give it a shot again soon.

If you have a complicated shape for the base of your home, then when you go to add the roof, it will be even more complex trying to figure out how to brute force tailor made circle pieces into the square holes. 

Always consider the roofing pieces you have available to you while setting up your floor or foundation.

gaming,Tell me about The Outer Wilds. Sell me on it even.,"Yes I'm currently playing some games and yes I've got an extensive backlog. But like most gamers, I'm always craving new and more experiences. And while I've heard nothing but praise about The Outer Wilds I virtually know nothing about it. I see that it's available in the Xbox store for $24.99 so I watched the trailer and revealed very little.

So tell me about this game please. What genre is it? What style is it? What is it's length and can it be played in short spurts along with other games or should one give their time fully to it? Are there any other titles that TOW might be comparable to? And what are you some aspects of the game that you feel really make it stand out.

gaming,What is the best combat system in an action game?,"I was just thinking about Assassin's Creed 2, a game I haven't played in a very long time. But I do remember that it was from before when the explicit indicators that someone was about to attack you was introduced. So it was on YOU to watch the enemies actions and predict their attacks. Time didn't slow down or anything and the enemies weren't slow. Their attacks could be quick and difficult to predict. So I remember having a really fun time with the combat in that game and I don't really know why AC2 and ACB aren't talked about for their fun, challenging, and well balanced combat.

There's also another game that I haven't played in a very long time. People used to talk all about how the Arkham games had the best combat system but I thought it paled in comparison to the most fun and fluid yet still challenging combat system, the best combat system in a game I have ever seen, the combat system of Sleeping Dogs. Now maybe I am remembering the combat too fondly since it was so long ago that I played it. And practically every single other thing in the game was done better by Rockstar in their GTA games. But the combat tho..... that shit was to die for🥵. Like, who would have thought that you could implement Kung Fu into a video game and not make an absolute clusterfuck of a system, but also actually make it good??? Fun, fluid, and challenging. A simplistic fundamental system that anyone can pick up yet made complex by the numerous combos you could learn as you progress in experience. The story, the money, the outfits, the cars..... everything in that game was just an excuse to facilitate a game that centres around what it was *really* made for; hand to hand combat by means of Kung Fu.

Like am I wrong about that? Because I don't hear people mention the combat in that game. Am I just fondly remembering a game that I played when I was a dumb incompetent kid? Or does it still hold up as an adult? And what other games had brilliant, renowned *or* underrated?",techscc,1hfjjgl,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hfjjgl/what_is_the_best_combat_system_in_an_action_game/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hfjjgl/what_is_the_best_combat_system_in_an_action_game/,2024-12-16 13:52:10,1,1.0,1,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfjjgl
