math,Do you do math because of succeeding or failing?,"Do you like to do Mathematics, because
- (1) you are good at it, and like to claim its achievements? or
- (2) because you enjoy the process of failing?

For me it is (2); I had always found Math hard, and enjoyed challenging myself. I think (1) leads to an unhealthy work ethic and shouldn't be the motivation.

What about you?",xTouny,1hf16v0,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf16v0/do_you_do_math_because_of_succeeding_or_failing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf16v0/do_you_do_math_because_of_succeeding_or_failing/,2024-12-15 20:12:34,116,0.8,116,0,117,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hf16v0

math,Proof by induction in algebra,"Is it just me or is proof by induction the single most common proof technique used in abstract algebra, at least at the late undergrad/early grad level?

I saw it quite a bit when I was teaching myself Galois theory, where I often saw the trick of applying the induction hypothesis to a number's (e.g., the degree of a splitting field) proper factors.  

Now, as I'm learning commutative algebra, it seems like every other theorem has a proof by induction.  I'm spending the afternoon learning the proof of the Noether normalization lemma, and of course, it's another inductive proof.

I never realized that induction was such an important proof technique.  But maybe it's because of the ""discreteness"" of algebra compared to analysis?  Come to think of it, I can't think of many proofs in analysis where induction plays a big role.  One that I could remember was the proof in Rudin that nonempty perfect sets are uncountable, which has an inductive construction, but I'm not sure if that strictly counts as a proof by induction.",WMe6,1hf2wss,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf2wss/proof_by_induction_in_algebra/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf2wss/proof_by_induction_in_algebra/,2024-12-15 21:30:26,39,0.95,39,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hf2wss
math,Bijective function on a bounded set to itself ,"I was wondering if anyone knew if any good functions that can map a bounded set onto itself (for example all integers within a given range to a unique value that same range). I know you could do it with a modulo function, but I think there has to be something more random-appearing. I am trouble finding good results with the terms I can think of for this (such as a bijective endofunction). Of course there are plenty of functions that can do this on an infinite set (such as any order 2 polynomial w/ integer coefficients can do it from its vertex to either side of the number line), but I can’t seem to think of a good way to do it on a bounded set. If there are any good terms to look up or anything like that it would be very much appreciated!
Edit: I realized this can be done in code by just shuffling the set randomly with a seed for reproducibility. I guess a shuffling algorithm is a pretty good way to do it if you have an ordered set, which is my use case",pignated,1heyjzz,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1heyjzz/bijective_function_on_a_bounded_set_to_itself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1heyjzz/bijective_function_on_a_bounded_set_to_itself/,2024-12-15 18:14:28,16,0.77,16,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1heyjzz

math,Pulling back model structure,"Suppose we have a faithful functor between bi-complete categories [; U:C'\rightarrow C;], and a model structure on [;C;]. Does taking pre-image of the classes of fibrations, cofibrations, and weak equivalences yields a model structure on [;C';] ?

math,Pearsons Rank Correlation turned into percentage,"Once you've done PRC you will get an R-value between (-1) and (+1).

If you then add 1 to that result and divide by 2

**(R+1)/2**

you will get an answer between 0-100. Is it correct to say that that is a percentage of how similar two tables are?

For example, two people rank their favorite ice-creams, instead of saying they have a negative R-value of (-0,2), is it still correct to say that they have 40% similar taste?",CarbonScythe0,1hffa28,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hffa28/pearsons_rank_correlation_turned_into_percentage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hffa28/pearsons_rank_correlation_turned_into_percentage/,2024-12-16 09:14:59,7,0.82,7,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hffa28
math,Intuition behind the definition of MCD as the sum of ideals in principal ideal domains.,"In my Algebra/Number theory course we have defined the MCD (only in PIDs) as the generator of the sum of ideals, meaning: 
MCD(a,b) = M  &lt;=&gt; (a)+(b) = (M),

where MCD means maximum common divisor and parenthesis denote the ideal generated by that element. 
I don't understand how this definition relates to the MCD in integers. If I take ax+by, why should that be a multiple of the MCD?? We have then used this for Bezout's identity and to solve diophantine equations in PIDs so it's pretty crucial.  

I also don't completely get why the mcm (minimum common multiple) is the intersection of ideals, in particular the inclusion (a)∩(b) ⊆ (m), where m = mcm(a,b).
If a number is a multiple of both a and b, why should it be a multiple of their mcm??
