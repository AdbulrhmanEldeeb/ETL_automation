gaming,Games with Japanese Cyberpunk Body Horror Aesthetic,"Let's talk about this, because it is one of my all time favorite aesthetics to explore and view. Biomech horror (specifically of the Japanese variety), prime examples of what I'm referring to:

Baroque

Observer

Dread Delusion

Hibernaculum 

Garage: Bad Dream Adventure 

Elemental Gearbolt (PS1)

Volfoss (PS1)

Galerians (PS1)

Hellnight (PS1)

Nemu Lu Mayu - Sleeping Cocoon (PS1)

Darkseed

Lust From Beyond

Scorn 

Axiom Verge

Golden Light

Alien Crush

R-Type

Angel's Gear



Notable mention of:

Koudelka (PS1)

SMT games, they have a lot of influence here sometimes

Wizardry Dimguil, it's more dark fantasy than the others with some INSANE creature designs

Phantasy Star, FF final bosses, Contra, anything Berserk/FromSoft



Specifically Baroque + Garage grab the aesthetic more than anything else I've played and I wish there was more adaptation of crazy grotesque influenced grime + cable aesthetic. Basically anything as a direct video game influence of any Tsukomoto or Yoshihiro Nishimura movie, with a splash of Akira. I have been researching into this genre for years now and I feel I have maybe covered everything and there is nothing left to find, so PLEASE let me know your suggestions! I love this art style and I want as much of it as there is left.
