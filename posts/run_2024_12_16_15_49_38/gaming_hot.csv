Baroque

Observer

Dread Delusion

Hibernaculum 

Garage: Bad Dream Adventure 

Elemental Gearbolt (PS1)

Volfoss (PS1)

Galerians (PS1)

Hellnight (PS1)

Nemu Lu Mayu - Sleeping Cocoon (PS1)

Darkseed

Lust From Beyond

Scorn 

Axiom Verge

Golden Light

Alien Crush

R-Type

Angel's Gear



Notable mention of:

Koudelka (PS1)

SMT games, they have a lot of influence here sometimes

Wizardry Dimguil, it's more dark fantasy than the others with some INSANE creature designs

Phantasy Star, FF final bosses, Contra, anything Berserk/FromSoft



Specifically Baroque + Garage grab the aesthetic more than anything else I've played and I wish there was more adaptation of crazy grotesque influenced grime + cable aesthetic. Basically anything as a direct video game influence of any Tsukomoto or Yoshihiro Nishimura movie, with a splash of Akira. I have been researching into this genre for years now and I feel I have maybe covered everything and there is nothing left to find, so PLEASE let me know your suggestions!

Recommend me some pve/pvm stuff where I can play solo, play at my own pace without having deadlines (like battle passes I need to complete, fomo content and not feeling like I’ll miss out on stuff that I’ll never be able to get again if I don’t finish it in x amount of time).

gaming,What is the best combat system in an action game?,"I was just thinking about Assassin's Creed 2, a game I haven't played in a very long time. But I do remember that it was from before when the explicit indicators that someone was about to attack you was introduced. So it was on YOU to watch the enemies actions and predict their attacks. Time didn't slow down or anything and the enemies weren't slow. Their attacks could be quick and difficult to predict. So I remember having a really fun time with the combat in that game and I don't really know why AC2 and ACB aren't talked about for their fun, challenging, and well balanced combat.

There's also another game that I haven't played in a very long time. People used to talk all about how the Arkham games had the best combat system but I thought it paled in comparison to the most fun and fluid yet still challenging combat system, the best combat system in a game I have ever seen, the combat system of Sleeping Dogs. Now maybe I am remembering the combat too fondly since it was so long ago that I played it. And practically every single other thing in the game was done better by Rockstar in their GTA games. But the combat tho..... that shit was to die for🥵. Like, who would have thought that you could implement Kung Fu into a video game and not make an absolute clusterfuck of a system, but also actually make it good??? Fun, fluid, and challenging. A simplistic fundamental system that anyone can pick up yet made complex by the numerous combos you could learn as you progress in experience. The story, the money, the outfits, the cars..... everything in that game was just an excuse to facilitate a game that centres around what it was *really* made for; hand to hand combat by means of Kung Fu.

Like am I wrong about that? Because I don't hear people mention the combat in that game. Am I just fondly remembering a game that I played when I was a dumb incompetent kid? Or does it still hold up as an adult?

My brother used to enjoy playing video games (mainly GTA Vice City, CoD and Brothers in Arms) but suffered a stroke 10 or so years ago. A couple of years after the stroke, he attempted to play but felt sick when playing certain games, particularly if there was a lot of action on screen or if it's too fast paced.

He's recently been mentioning that he'd like to get back into gaming, so I've bought him an Xbox Series X for Christmas. Just wondering which games people could recommend for someone who suffers from video motion sickness?

So a few friends and I have been into playing a lot of gameshow type couch coop games, and we're looking for new ones to play. Lately we've really been into Monopoly and Wheel of Fortune on PS5, and have also dabbled in Jeopardy and Family Feud a few times. Basically, we've been really into boardgame type games lately, but not opposed to other kinds of coop games similar.

We've run out of ideas of anything new to play though, do any of you have any suggestions for good games to play coop? I have a range of system, but usually just stick with PS5 and the Steam Deck.

gaming,What would be a good setting for a new Assassin's Creed game?,"It's true, we complain a lot about Assassins Creed. Whether its the fact that Ubisoft likes money (gasp), the games are historically inaccurate (true), or that certain demographics are forced (that is a subjective argument that I'd like to ignore for this topic.

That being said, the settings of the previous AC's have several things in common: a land with a prolonged conflict, between classes, ethnicities or religion. Neither party has control over the whole map and fighting occurs sporadically and locally. Usually the map involves different cities and the newer games involve naval battles. You also meet up and coming scientists and philosophers and new technologies become available. That being said, I hereby present my idea:

The Netherlands during the 80 years' war 1568-1648).

Hear me out. During this period the Dutch had their ""golden age"", mastering the seas, even though they had a war of independence with Spain. The Dutch were protestant, Spain catholic, which lead to regional warfare where the occupied south practiced Catholicism and the north Protestantism. Several cities were sieged with new inventions, like the Dutch using pumps to drain water protecting the besieged cities. With regards to art, science and philosophy; Jheronimus Bosch and Leeghwater come to mind and also the fact that the VOC was founded, the first publicly owned company with a very dubious past. It was also a time when many of the amazing buildings we are still mesmerising over were being built and when ""the new world"" was still new (the Dutch founded New York in 1624).

That being said, it would help if Ubisoft would try to not make all the Dutch people speak Gernan.

[https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/](https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202412120001/)

From Famitsu:

**--Even though there is an online main mode, why did you include the single mode ""Old Amasia Investigation""?**

**Futami**　I didn't want to make a game that would become unplayable if online play were to become unavailable in the future, so I prepared a single mode. Of course, we intend to continue the service, and I don't want it to be taken in a negative sense, but I wanted players to feel reassured that this is not a game that they will no longer be able to play. I also wanted to draw a contrast as a story. In the main story, the player and their own Magus will depict the drama of each player. However, it is not conveyed from within the game how the player interacts with other Magus. So, by looking at the relationship between Alba and Ada, I wanted players to be aware of the relationship between themselves and their own Magus.

**--It has increased a little recently, but most online games cannot be played again once the service ends, so that is a nice consideration.**

**Futami**　Of course, we want to continue the service, but we wanted to get rid of the feeling that the game would become unplayable once the service ends.

**--Will it be possible to play the game completely offline from the beginning?**

**Futami**　No, the introduction to online play is absolutely necessary, and it is unlocked once you have progressed to a certain extent. It is a mode that can be played even after the service ends, but it is not set to be playable completely offline from the time of release.

　Of course, we are considering how to deal with that situation, but we are only making it possible to deal with it, and we do not want to change our stance that it is basically a ""mode that is useful for online play,"" so at this time online play is also required.

From GamerNE:

\--This game is an online-only title, but I think it's quite rare for an online-only title to be sold as a one-time purchase.

Futami: That's right... I think what everyone is worried about on that point is, ""Will I no longer be able to play the game once the service ends?""

However, I would like to make it clear that even if the online service ends, the game will still be playable.

\--What do you mean?

Futami: It's true that currently, online play is required to play this game, but we've already prepared a way to make it possible to play offline. The reason it's required to be online is because we don't want to store data locally to prevent so-called cheating.

Of course, since the game is primarily online, there will be limitations to what you can play, but please rest assured that the packages and games you purchase will not be completely wasted.",JaSonic2199,1heahcu,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heahcu/synduality_echo_of_ada_has_offline_modes_planned/,2024-12-14 19:32:43,37,0.75,37,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heahcu

As creators and game makers, we have too long been led away from the truth, away from the right to define ourselves as artists in service of the definitive art form of the future, one that has made us dream since we were children.

Instead, the disposability culture operating at the ruthless core of this industry wants us to think of ourselves as cogs in the machine: rudimentary craftsmen, disposable career workers, inert producers of made-to-order marketing-driven ""content"" — empty calories leaving the soul hungry.

The Profiteer knows that by keeping your dignity low, he will keep you crawling on the treadmill of passion until he lays you off for the sake of the red number in his book.

We make games because we have to. It is our calling. Because we have no choice but to see the transformative potential of this youngest medium of human interaction. You can't turn away once you've seen the light,Or it will always feel like everyone else in the world is doing something without you, there in the light you try to abandon but can't, because — oh, the horror — it comes from inside you.

All art is communication — dialogue across time, space and thought. In its rawest, it is one mind’s ability to provoke emotion in another.Large language models— simulacra, cold comfort, real-doll pocket-pussy, cyberspace freezer of an abandoned IM-chat — which are today passed off for “artificial intelligence”,will never be able to offer a dialogue with the vision of another human being.

Machine-generated works will never satisfy or substitute the human desire for art, as our desire for art is in its core a desire for communication with another,with a talent who speaks to us across worlds and ages to remind us of our all-encompassing human universality. There is no one to connect to in a large language model. The phone line is open but there’s no one on the other side.

The peddlers who aim to get rich quick from this scheme will always PLAY THE FOOL to any ethical or artistic argument. This is why we must push back against Big Tech's encroachment on the territory of our art,against increasing corporatization and alienation of game creators from their work, against the robbery of rights from workers, performers, artists and all contributors to this complicated and MULTI-FACETED medium.

Our mission is to unite world-class artists and creatives in a truly independent game studio which will always prioritize artistic integrity over personal comfort, profit margin, short term interests and Big Tech profit-bubbles.

There we will be able to embark on that treacherous road of building a cultural megaproject, a Role Playing Game with complexity and ambition worthy to rival our wretched and wonderful world.

In this we are committed to pursue the highest caliber of literary quality.

Here we stand, bound by our love for games and devotion to our craft, ready to bleed and weep and ride the cavalry into machine gun fire one more time.

For this we will need all the support and help from you, our readers, colleagues and future visionaries. Come walk the desert with us.

We will not take any of your support for granted.We have seen the suffering wrought by the hunger for power, the terror of greed and envy, the complicity of the averted eye. We have also seen the triumph of the human spirit, of solidarity in the striving, of making something never before seen and seeing its miracle unfold in the world. We have seen poverty, and we have seen plenty. We will make mistakes, we will win and we will fail, but we will never forget what we are doing this for.  
  
Yours in every season,

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - was anyone disappointed by the game’s last act?,"So, I’ll open up by saying I really loved the game. I wasn’t expecting to like (or even play) this one, but I’m very glad that did. 

Still, I felt like the later areas lacked a lot of the polish of the first half of the game. 

&gt;! Vatican City and Gizeh were both so fun to play through. By the time I got to Siam, though, the game felt much less polished. I encountered a number of pretty rough bugs - one game breaking, most just annoying.!&lt;

Did anyone else find the number of bugs increasing in the final few zones? Did anyone else feel like those parts of the game felt less polished or more rushed?

Just curious how others felt. This was a game that was almost a 10/10 for me — and one that really surprised me mechanically, since I don’t really like any of the gameplay elements in other games/on their own — but the friction as I got later on really pulled things down.

gaming,The Souls-like genre is becoming oversaturated - agree or disagree?,"The souls-like genre has really blown up over the past 5 years or so. Before then it was mostly Fromsoft games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, etc), with a few lower quality imitators (The Surge, Lords of the Fallen, Mortal Shell, etc).

There are a lot of souls-likes now. Like, too many maybe, to the point of oversaturation. The soulslike genre is starting to feel like how the rhythm genre felt a decade ago, before it imploded on itself and died. It’s not unexpected for developers to shift towards making games in this genre, especially after Elden Ring was so successful, and it’s not even that the games themselves are low quality like before. Titles like Lies of P, Black Myth Wukong, and Thiasma are genuinely excellent games.

I think it becomes an issue of innovation and repetition. The genre seems to be nearing its peak in terms of mechanics and innovation, or at least as far as devs are willing to take it. Most games in the genre play like Dark Souls 3, a game that came out nearly a decade ago. The most innovation the genre has seen is incorporating deflects like in Sekiro and Lies of P. Even Elden Ring, which many would consider to be the peak of the genre, other than the open world, is mechanically identical to DS3. I don’t think anyone can deny that these games aren’t high quality and fantastic, but they all play very similarly, and it seems like it’s going to be difficult to advance the genre further than where it’s at. 

And yet, because the genre is successful, games are likely going to be pumped out until the genre dies. Unlike shooters or sports games, I don’t think this genre can survive long term while recycling its own mechanics and ideas over and over again. Fromsoft, who are undeniably the top of the food chain in this genre, even seem to be running out of ideas for actual gameplay innovation, and are pushing the enemies difficulty further in bizarre ways such as delayed hits, leading to controversial bosses like the final boss of the Elden Ring DLC and quite a few others from that game.

Maybe it’s burnout on my part. I’ve been playing these games for over a decade, since Demon’s Souls on PS3. I was able to see the genre advance to where it is now, and to me, it’s been stagnant for at least the last 5 years. I wasn’t even able to finish the Elden Ring DLC as it felt so samey to everything else that’s come out in the last few years, and by the time I beat the final boss, I just shelved the game and had no drive to explore the rest of the DLC or to start up a new run with the new builds introduced in the DLC, which would be unheard of just a few years ago. 

I don’t expect that this topic will be well received given how popular the genre is right now, and again, it’s not like the games coming out are bad by any means (and indeed, are routinely game of the year contenders now). But I also would not be surprised if the genre has mostly died out by 2030, particularly if innovation isn’t ramped up. But I wouldn’t even know how to suggest innovation, the genre has potentially reached a peak in that regard. Anyways, interested to see what others have to say on the subject.

I see that it's available in the Xbox store for $24.99 so I watched the trailer and revealed very little.

So tell me about this game please. What genre is it? What style is it? What is it's length and can it be played in short spurts along with other games or should one give their time fully to it? Are there any other titles that TOW might be comparable to? And what are you some aspects of the game that you feel really make it stand out.

gaming,Microsoft's $100B Acquisitions: Apparently the New-Original IPs are staying Xbox-Exclusive (for now),"**Note:** As of now I only own PS5 and may setup (budget issues, lol) a PC in next couple of years if non-PS games really become attractive to me. Even though I'll get downvoted but I personally feel that there should be some exclusives attached to a brand if a brand is targeting a platform/hardware system. Since MS has spent 100B on acquiring studios, its simply not possible to keep everything exclusive as PS is the moneymaker in software as well. But I observed a very cool thing. I've seen that apart from few exceptions (Hellblade 2 &amp; Licensed IPs), Xbox hasn't announced new-owned IPs for Playstation, YET. Yes, lots of games 1st party games are announced for PS but those were already the games which had their previous parts released on PS and weren't closely associated with Xbox brand. Saying that, following is what I've observed. \[*I'm excluding PC and Nintendo from this discussion as Nintendo seems to be on another plane while PC has been adopted by even Sony*\]

* **New Original IPs:** Exclusive to Xbox for now
   1. Starfield
   2. Avowed
   3. Perfect Dark
   4. South of Midnight
   5. Clockwork Revolution
   6. Everwild
   7. Redfall
* **Signature IPs:** Have always been associated with Xbox (or MS in case of Flight Simulator)
   1. Halo Infinite
   2. Forza Horizon 5
   3. Forza Motorsport 2023
   4. State of Decay 3
   5. Fable 2025
   6. Gears E-Day
   7. MS Flight Simulator 2020 &amp; 2024
* **Owned IPs:** Announced or released for PS
   * COD: Black Ops 6
   * Diablo 4
   * Doom: The Dark Ages
   * The Outer Worlds 2
   * Sea of Thieves
   * Deathloop
   * Ghostwire: Tokyo
* Exceptions
   * Hellblade 2 - Still seems to be exclusive even though part 1 was released on PS, so it's a bit difficult to associate this brand with Xbox. May become multi platform
   * Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle - Licensed IP. Would have been nice for a good xbox game to be exclusive but since branding is the main thing so it may not have much of an impact.
   * Blade - May become multi-platform. It's a Marvel brand so no point of pushing it to become Xbox's brand
* State of Xbox - Rumors/Confirmations/Observations
   * GamePass seems to be the core brand for MS Gaming and future
   * Pushing for everything to be ""This is an Xbox"".
   * There's still one more console that they'll release as per Sarah Bond

I think having these 14-15 big exclusive IPs can still be realistic to manage and will also add prestige to xbox brand just like PS has God of War, Uncharted, LOU, Intergalactic, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, Infamous, Astrobot, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Resistance, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Returnal, Days Gone and many others.",blinkyretard,1heqz2v,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heqz2v/microsofts_100b_acquisitions_apparently_the/,2024-12-15 11:46:20,0,0.28,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1heqz2v

gaming,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - PS5 vs PC comparison,"Lighting and Shadows
The PC version significantly improves lighting. Characters’ faces appear more lifelike with balanced illumination, and the shadows are sharper with better depth, making scenes with Aerith and Cloud stand out even more.

Background Details
The environments look much clearer and more refined. Effects like the glowing bokeh in Aerith’s scene appear smoother, while Cloud’s surroundings benefit from sharper textures and greater detail.

Texture Quality
The PC version enhances textures across the board. Aerith’s hair shows individual strands, and Cloud’s outfit looks crisper and more detailed, making the characters feel even more realistic.

Color Grading
Colors on PC are richer and more vibrant, with improved contrast. It avoids the slightly washed-out look seen on PS5, resulting in a more visually dynamic presentation.

Ambient Occlusion &amp; Effects
Small details, like shading in clothing folds and subtle creases, are much more refined. Additionally, effects like glowing particles are smoother and more polished, adding to the overall visual depth.",Tomozuki,1heis71,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1heis71/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth_ps5_vs_pc_comparison/,https://i.redd.it/bmlpq3tbax6e1.jpeg,2024-12-15 02:23:00,0,0.48,0,0,47,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NoHXWvNKIZbN4D4sFBWeJK-thQEE6PHoIasXgjAoSfk.jpg,t3_1heis71

gaming,A Fjord I made in Minecraft,"This Inlet is part of major fjord I have been developing in my Minecraft world called Sky Pixel. The fjord itself is called the ""Lullaby Fjord"" it is surrounded by large tidewater glaciers I have been making for quite some time now. 

This world is also already released on my Patreon (Sky Pixel) for users to experience and download.

Much of my builds can also be seen on my YT channel @elijahjones as well. 

This build is a small section of my world that I have been developing since 2014. Which includes many cities and landscapes. 

This glacier itself is called the ""Porter Glacier"" it's part of a series of glaciers that run near it such as the ""Harlette, Kusuah, Ellie, Jacie, Rezjvik, Lunaska, and Sathomko glaciers"" amongst others. 

This area I have been developing in my world is inspired by the Pacific Northwest landscapes. I've been doing a ton of developing similar to these landscapes because I was born and raised in the PNW. This area in particular is mostly focused on areas of British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska. I have already developed much of areas within the Cascades and Coast Mountains already. Just making my way up the line. And almost done with this region in my world.

gaming,"6 Decades of gaming, 6 Decades of Male Main Characters","Gaming as a whole has been oddly male oriented for decades, even after the gaming census a couple years ago and all data collected showing nearly 48% of ""gamers"" are women, men still seem to be the vocal majority. Recently during the game awards and this year, we've seen a bunch of trailers with females as the main protagonist (which i have absolutely no issue with, considering Lora Croft paved the way for some badass characters).

The vocal minority of social media trolls immediately jumping on the 30 second-5 minute trailers as "" woke "" or "" agenda driven "" has really made me wonder why are we so oddly angry about this now?  Take Witcher 4 for an idea, all i see is comments about people being angry that the STORY DRIVEN narrative is now Cersi's perspective even though that's the only direction it should have went. 

Some incredible games have came with female leads

Tomb Raider

Horizon Zero Dawn

The Last of Us

Cyberpunk 2077 (V is canonically female)

Bayonetta

Yet the gaming community is so wrapped up in this toxic understanding that gaming companies are pushing any sort of agenda. Of course companies have the right to produce anything they like, and the fact that most of these misogynistic apelike men masturbated to Lora Croft growing up in their miserable bedrooms, and most likely still do, what is it about now that makes you so unnecessarily loud. We pride companies on following their own values.

Just irritated how video games have fallen into this absolutely abysmal state because everyone is sucked into the abyss of politics they have NO idea about. 

Get excited for games again, give games a chance, and stop immedietly jumping on the bandwagon of "" this game sucks."" without even a second of gameplay available.

gaming,Witcher 4 Controversy ,"The Witcher 4 trailer and the discussions around it really have me thinking, we aren’t ever gonna solve the problem with bickering in gaming are we? I mean I have seen so many comments complaining about people who are complaining that they “don’t want to play as a girl” than I have of actual people complaining about playing a girl. It’s got the point where people are so ready for outrage and bigotry that they pre-empt it, which in turn causes the bigotry and complaints they didn’t want to see. Now I am not saying there aren’t some weird bigots out there because there are. But man we are so ready for L takes that we start to complain about them when they don’t exist and almost breath life into them. 

I thought the trailer was great and it hyped me up. It’s sad to see the state of the gaming community, I think social media has a lot to blame for this tbh. I personally don’t like forced inclusivity, you know the kind where the protagonist is a minority and the devs harp on about their gender, ethnicity, cultural background or sexual orientation more than they do the game mechanics or story, ye that I dislike. This however, isn’t that. It’s been very obvious where they were going after the Witcher 3 and this feels like a natural progression.

Rockstar Games dont need those shows really, they can shadowdrop on a monday at 7 am and still sell hilarious number.. Switch 2 .. same story Nintendo does their own stuff, whenever they want to. .

But.. for me most notably: 

What about the new Fable? Shouldnt there be some gameplay by now? This game has been in dev for ages.. (also since Playground games works hard on this.. is Forza Horizon on ice?)

Judas (from Ken Levine, Bioshock founder) should also be playable? No Trailers? Should we be worried? A new Bioshock game is also in develoopment right now... 

 I thought we might get a few hints about new Marvel games.. Wolverine? Blade? 

No news from the KOTOR remake.. 

I thought about Devil May Cry aswell,but Capcom had Okami and Onimusha so that was great.

Silksong?

Kojima was there.. but no new Death Stranding 2 infos... sus?

Doom Dark Ages?

gaming,Game recommendations ,"Hi, i’ve been playing video games for most of my life and lately i’ve been playing every new game i get in the hardest difficulty setting because i find them boringly easy otherwise. 

Right now i’m sorta running out of difficult experiences and so i thought why not make a post on here to ask for any of you guys recommendations. 

If you know of any hard but fair game, whether niche or popular, feel free to name it. 

Here are just a few guidelines though:
- single player would be better

- no rogue likes/lites or bullet hells because I just don’t really like them sorry

- the game must still be somewhat fair. I don’t want inflated difficulty just for the sake of « ahah my game is absolutely unbeatable »

-I’ve already played fromsoft games so no need to recommend those


Anything else is fair game. I’m not sure this post’ll really work out but i thought i’d give it a shot.

gaming,Why are people calling the Intergalactic premise/aesthetic unoriginal?  What about Uncharted and the Last of Us was original to you?,"
I know it’s cool to hate on Naughty Dog at the moment but to try and bash this trailer by calling the premise unoriginal is hilarious to me.  

Uncharted and The Last of Us are both phenomenal franchises but they both HEAVILY borrow themes and aesthetics from existing media, and that’s part of their charm.  Naughty Dog do not make experimental, avant-garde games.  They design games in environments we’re familiar with from films, literature and other video games and they do it better than anyone else - that’s precisely the reason they’re so popular.

The only reason this is now suddenly an issue is unfortunately obvious following the discourse surrounding Naughty Dog lately but it’s so frustrating because all I want to do is engage in a positive discussion over what is a really fucking impressive trailer. 

The technical achievements alone in that trailer are absolutely outstanding.  The animation, the voice work, the fucking AWESOME original soundtrack.  That’s what we should be discussing here surely, and I hate that some people are writing off a trailer like that because of pre-determined personal bias.",Finellaclark,1hdlxh4,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdlxh4/why_are_people_calling_the_intergalactic/,2024-12-13 20:49:00,0,0.41,0,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hdlxh4

gaming,Balatro’s Success got me thinking of some other unorthodox roguelike ideas,"A poker inspired rogue-like becoming one of the most lauded indies of recent memory is definitely not something that was on my 2024 bingo card. But it got me thinking… what are some other genres that haven’t been explored by the often dubbed “over explored” genre of roguelikes?

Specifically, I thought of bowling and darts. Choose to start off a run with a specific bowling ball or dart set with their own unique playstyles. Upgrade your rolling or throwing techniques with rogue-like abilities. Add cool interactions between the bowling pins or the way darts are scored. If there are any hidden games like these please inform me as I would love to check them out. 

Additionally I was thinking that maybe the rogue-like genre could be a good way to reintroduce the old-school arcady street sports games from the 2000s. The industry has pivoted away from them for whatever reason but maybe put it under the umbrella of the popular rogue-like genre and we could get a spiritual successor to those nostalgic games.

I feel a few weeks ago, Palworld's popularity was steadily dying and that the initial hype was more 'trend' than substance (not that Palworld is a bad game, but that the launch hype was something that they likely would never get close to replicating again).

But now after the lawsuit, at least in my head, I feel like Palworld as a franchise has gone from 'indie one hit wonder' to something more meaningful and long-standing. It feels like the fight against Nintendo makes Palworld even that much more legitimate of a gaming universe going forward... The full release of Palworld is going to go viral again merely off of all the new lawsuit drama lol

gaming,The industry’s AAA revenue problem,"After the very real issue of layoffs and the sometimes toxic revenue model of the industry was brought to the forefront at The Game Awards last night I thought I would create a post to have a constructive discussion on the state of the industry if we can (please try).
The industry has a genuine problem.   The cost of what we consider AAA or even AA game development is at an all time high.   The old model of just selling a game for $70 and hoping to sell enough copies to make money doesn’t work anymore.  If this model was retained, the baseline price tag of most games should really be $120 for example…but consumers don’t want that. Companies are mandating either micro transactions, live-service, etc as a way to even just stay in business let alone profitable.  Gamers generally don’t want that either…but it has worked. There’s nothing wrong with profit; it often helps funds next projects.   No one is staying in this business if they are not making profit. We have seen how many companies have gone out of business even when gaming switched from SD to HD graphics with the 360 era.   Companies are less likely to take risks on new IP because they don’t want to lose money.  We have seen larger companies like Microsoft make massive acquisitions of several smaller studios and have said it’s bad for the industry; but how many of those companies would have eventually gone the way of Midway and just gone out of business eventually.   If you’re still reading this; thank you…just wanted to put some thoughts out there to have some focused discussions…not rants, discussions hopefully.

gaming,"Has there ever been a game recommendation website that behaves similar to how social media sites recommend friends based on ""mutual friends"", where it will recommend games based on ""mutual games"", however the games are reverse-weighted?","Specifically, I was thinking of a sort of unique algorithm, where it would weight games based on reverse-popularity (or at least a toggle feature for it).

So, a game like Super Mario World on SNES, or Sonic on Sega Genesis would have a very low weight, due to it's popularity (measured by how many others have the game favorited).

Whereas, a game like Gain Ground on Sega Genesis, or Xardion on SNES would have a very low weigh, due to their popularity, and the fact that me and 3 other people have played them.

My thinking is, say I had 100 of variety of games ""favorited"". Of those, if I have 20 niche games, and it pairs me up with someone who also has some of those games in their list, it would stand to reason, we have a very similar taste in games (with the other lower-weighted games help support it), and should have a very high likelyhood of enjoying what other games the other person has favorited that we are unaware of.

The website can also offer suggestions independent of other users, by stack ranking your list against the popularity of other titles, using the same algorithm.

Has this been done before? Can others see the logic in what I'm saying? Does someone want to steal this idea and make a site for it?

gaming,Game narrative idea,"This is just a loose overview not a beat by beat. 

1. Player is working for a mentor performing assignments. To keep it simple let's say getting to and destroying guarded broadcast towers which are (they are told) being used to subjugate villagers. 


2. As they are partway through completing one of these quests, something gets their attention about this being not quite as believed. Further investigation unveils that these are _not_ subjugating people but form a defence network. 

The player, instead of helping people, is endangering them. The guards are also villagers protecting their defences. In fact the very mentor who directed them is a villain.

3. Although they don't have direct interaction with the mentor until the end, the enemies along the way work for the mentor. 

The player now desires to undo the damage they have done but, unsurprisingly, the villagers don't trust them so that's an additional hurdle. The player killed their friends and neighbours so at best they will get a begrudging compliance. 

4. The final boss is the former mentor (yes, this has been done before such as in Assassin's Creed 1) who has gained power in the background after the player helped them. The player does not want to fight and maybe kill the mentor but is left with no alternative.

""Oh, what do we have here?  You seem to have had a very, very, bad day.  I know just the ...thing... that might - just - help.  Ah!  And here it is now.""

A spaceship is heard arriving off screen and a glowing blue cord with a little circle at the end flows out of it after a pop.  The string grabs the Microchip and pulls it towards the still off-screen ship.  Slowly, the ship is revealed and with it a familiar silhouette pulling the cord.  It's SACKBOY!

Sackboy thinks for a moment before jumping up in excitement and opening up his pop-it and creates a Sackbot from thin air.  Using his Pop-It-Cursor, he opens the Sackbots Microchip Brain and places the mysterious space microchip inside it.

Immediately, a pair of round blue eyes pop up on the Sackbots previously empty wooden face, with some glitching.  No other features appear.

""Can you tell us what happened to you?""  The Sackbot thinks and shakes its head, ""no"".  

""No? Well, then perhaps we should just start, with your name, can you tell us that?""
