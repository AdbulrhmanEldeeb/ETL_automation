MachineLearning,[R] Optimizing LLM merging to reduce performance tradeoffs,"We just released our new [work](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.04144) on large-scale merging across checkpoints trained with different hyperparameters, data mixture, objectives, etc. to optimize tradeoffs. For instance, some models that perform well on code generation do worse on instruction following and vice versa. An interesting question to ask whether model merging can lead to a Pareto-optimal model in such setup.

  
**TL;DR:**

AS you're developing an LLM, it is common to obtain different checkpoints, where each excels at a single or a group of tasks/capabilities. Typically, you can keep tuning your hyperparameters until you obtain a Pareto-Optimal model, but the process can be super expensive. We show that you can collect all these models into a pool, and optimize merging parameters to reduce the task tradeoffs. We show that simple linear merging can yield Pareto-Optimal models in different tradeoff scenarios---better tradeoffs than individual models and strong merging baselines. Interestingly, our optimized merges outperform the original models in some cases. Our study uses large-scale models (Command R+ 104B from Cohere) and explores merging up to 16 checkpoints from SFT/RLHF training.

MachineLearning,[D] Understanding the Technology Behind Chat GPT‚Äôs Agent Routing ,"Good morning. When talking with ChatGPT, you‚Äôll notice it routes to different agents. This means that if you want to create an image using DALL¬∑E, it automatically identifies your intent and directs you to that agent. I was wondering what technology is behind this. Is it a small transformer model that classifies prompts and sends them to the corresponding agents? Or perhaps a smaller LLM that routes to the agents using a structured output?

I‚Äôm building a router that needs to decide which agent to use, and I‚Äôd love to know how other companies are handling this.
