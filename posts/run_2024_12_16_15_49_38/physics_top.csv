Physics,Why would a container of liquid oscillate on a hot plate way before the liquid boils.,This happened recently when we boiled milk in a container that had a curved base. It was a hot plate and not an induction stove. We had just turned on the stove and the everything was at rest. We didn’t touch the container but suddenly the container started to oscillate. It was strange because the milk was not boiling. It actually boiled much much later than this and the whole time it was oscillating. The oscillations were also in phases it seems (maybe because the hot plate actually doesn’t continuously heat but does it in waves) But Why would the container oscillate/vibrate?,Pen_Pine_Apple,1hfg7x3,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hfg7x3/why_would_a_container_of_liquid_oscillate_on_a/,https://i.redd.it/67ge3ptqt67e1.gif,2024-12-16 10:27:52,72,0.88,72,0,25,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,Image,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/w7iULzT55LHxCt0sUuvV_Sg0e6KBx_GfrxxZAvAP3y4.jpg,t3_1hfg7x3
Physics,Can we actually detect time dilation?,"The thing is, when things go faster, their time slows down relative to a stationary observer. But they also become smaller in size, relative to a stationary observer. This means that the space the it occupies relative to everything else is different depending on what speed it is on.

My question is, if for example we have a light clock that a second for it is a light wave hitting 2 mirrors 300 million times. And then we will have 2 identical clocks, one moving, and one stationary. How would we observer time dilation if the moving clock's volume has decreased due to its speed, and ask the faster you go, the less smaller you get, (relative to a stationary observer), this means the light wave will have then less distance to move, which will then increase the rate of the second being initiated, which will then nullify the time dilation effect.

Physics,Physics vs Abstraction ,"I found a guy telling me he is a physicist (or some kind Scientist by his word, I didn't trust him tho) on reddit, I am not a physicist, I am just an engineer doing developer work for a while after some years of research.

I want some of your opinions on this because I was stunned by his take, as it was: a 3D objects is not made by infinite 2D planes or that a line is not made by infinite points because there are no empirical 0D ""points"" that can be observed.

Zero as a concept doesn't exist to him because it doesn't exist in reality.

I tried to explain to him that zero is a concept that model reality, as we do have for example 5 apples and remove 5 apples then we have 0 apples, 0 models that empirica evidence, and that models are **never** really proven in physics.
Things are observed, but the link between models and the physical world requires always an abstraction jump which is than approved by the ability of predicting results.

Am I crazy or does he seems to fail to realize that physics never actually proves the link between models which is set in the world of reasoning and ideas, and observation which is in the physical world? because that little jump is always needed, he wanted me to prove empirically that this link existed to call 0 as something empirically evident.

In short (normal take) a model is a model because it works, doesn't it? At the end of the day: A line is modelled by infinite points because it works, A 3D objects is modelled by infinite 2D shapes because it works, like when we do integrals and we have predictive results.

it's not like we prove the link between the model and the observation itself like that's fucking insane.

Anyway he said I don't have proof of this, I would need a paper to prove what I said and that I reason as a flat earther would because I trust things without evidence. Not joking.
Guys did I found an acoustic scientist?

Physics,Sourcing Cosmological Data - E.g. Type Ia Supernovae Spectra &amp;  CMB ,"Hello Everyone,

Not sure if this might be more suited to a more specific subreddit, but I'm sure this will one do.

I'm currently in the process of studying physics and cosmology, and as someone with some programming knowledge, I thought it would be fun to calculate the age of the universe using Python with math libraries as a way to learn more. I wish to make a calculation a fair bit more precise and in line with current cosmological understanding rather than, for example, a simpler equation that assumes a constant rate of expansion.

My goal is to approach the problem with as few assumptions as possible and to build the necessary mathematical models and equations from scratch (within reason). I'm particularly interested in using observational data to calculate the required cosmological parameters and ultimately the age of the universe. I'm relatively comfortable with mathematics, including intermediate calculus, which I assume will be sufficient.

As a rough outline, I'm hoping to begin with plotting the Hubble diagram and determining a value for the Hubble constant using the redshift magnitude, recessional velocity, and distance data related to Type Ia supernovae; determining and refining values for a mathematical model of the expansion of the universe with the lamba-CDM model and Friedmann equations; and finally using this to make an accurate calculation. This appears to be a suitable strategy.

I'm searching for sources of data that I can download and use in my calculations. I've searched [https://www.wiserep.org/search/spectra,](https://www.wiserep.org/search/spectra) which is promising but unfortunately doesn't allow me to download the data for some reason.

From what I've figured so far, I'll mainly require the following data:

* Spectroscopic Data - Type Ia Supernovae or Potentially Cepheid Variable - For determining the magnitude of redshift and the recessional velocity
* B-band Magnitude Data for Distance Modulus Calculation - For the above objects (Not sure if this would normally be included)
* Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - Data from the CMB that will assist in calculating/refining certain cosmological parameters, including particular density values, geometric properties of the universe, and others that are present in the Lambda-CDM model and the Friedmann equations.
* Any other suggestions for data to collect that might assist

I'm happy to share the results via a GitHub repo or something similar once completed if anyone is interested. If anyone knows any websites or other materials that I may find useful, please let me know. Also, if I'm potentially operating out of my depth with any of the material here, let me know, and I can change strategies to something a little more simple.

I understand this is quite an in-depth inquiry, and I don't expect a comprehensive answer (researching myself is part of the fun), but I thought I’d reach out in case anyone has any insights or advice they’d be willing to share. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, and I’m grateful for any help offered!",Illustrious-Deal9505,1hfb9c5,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hfb9c5/sourcing_cosmological_data_eg_type_ia_supernovae/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hfb9c5/sourcing_cosmological_data_eg_type_ia_supernovae/,2024-12-16 04:34:53,1,0.55,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hfb9c5

Physics,Should clocks that move faster actually detect time dilation?,"Here is what I have observed. Let's say we have a clock that has a light wave inside of it. This light wave needs to hit 2 mirrors for it to be a second, and let's say the distance between the mirrors is 50 cm. So it will take 300 million hits for it to be a second. Let's say we have 2 of them, and we send on near the speed of light, and we keep one stationary. This should make it that the time detected on the faster moving clock is less than the stationary one. But that shouldn't be observed.

The thing is, faster moving things relative to a stationary object get smaller, so the 50 cm distance that the light wave has to cross now is way less, so it will take less time for said light wave to make the 300 million hits, so more seconds will be detected by the clock, relative to the slowed down time, so, the reading on the clock will be more than it should.

This means that if time dilation really exists, then the time read on both clocks should be the same (This is a guesstimation), or at least different than the one that the equation tell us. So what does this mean? Is time dilation now something that doesn't exist?
