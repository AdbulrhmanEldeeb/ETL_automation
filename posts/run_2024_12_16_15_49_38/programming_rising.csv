programming,Are people really asked to solve leetcode-style problems in interviews?,"I’ve been interviewing candidates recently (big tech company) and have talked to a few who were worried I was going to ask them to solve some classic CS algorithm. I’m not very familiar with leetcode but it comes up as the source of their anxiety

I have candidates do live coding and always emphasize that I do.not.care. if they mix up syntax, forget something obvious, or even get the code to finish the task. The tasks I have people do are intentionally super-easy and if someone struggles
I adjust to make it understandable to them.
Coding while being judged is stressful and it honestly takes maybe 3 minutes of watching/listening to someone work to get a feel for their competence- and that has nothing to do with their ability to solve n-queens under a spotlight

 Questions for both sides about leetcode-style live coding 

* as an interviewee, How did you do? Did you like it? Did it feel fair? 

* as an interviewer doing these, why? Compared
to soft skills how much weight do you put on these?",shatGippity,1hflazu,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hflazu/are_people_really_asked_to_solve_leetcodestyle/,https://leetcode.com,2024-12-16 15:15:11,4,0.63,4,0,19,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1hflazu
