For me it is (2); I had always found Math hard, and enjoyed challenging myself. I think (1) leads to an unhealthy work ethic and shouldn't be the motivation.

math,Intuition behind the definition of MCD as the sum of ideals in principal ideal domains.,"In my Algebra/Number theory course we have defined the MCD (only in PIDs) as the generator of the sum of ideals, meaning: 
MCD(a,b) = M  &lt;=&gt; (a)+(b) = (M),

where MCD means maximum common divisor and parenthesis denote the ideal generated by that element. 
I don't understand how this definition relates to the MCD in integers. If I take ax+by, why should that be a multiple of the MCD?? We have then used this for Bezout's identity and to solve diophantine equations in PIDs so it's pretty crucial.  

I also don't completely get why the mcm (minimum common multiple) is the intersection of ideals, in particular the inclusion (a)∩(b) ⊆ (m), where m = mcm(a,b).
If a number is a multiple of both a and b, why should it be a multiple of their mcm??

math,Proof by induction in algebra,"Is it just me or is proof by induction the single most common proof technique used in abstract algebra, at least at the late undergrad/early grad level?

I saw it quite a bit when I was teaching myself Galois theory, where I often saw the trick of applying the induction hypothesis to a number's (e.g., the degree of a splitting field) proper factors.  

Now, as I'm learning commutative algebra, it seems like every other theorem has a proof by induction.  I'm spending the afternoon learning the proof of the Noether normalization lemma, and of course, it's another inductive proof.

I never realized that induction was such an important proof technique.  But maybe it's because of the ""discreteness"" of algebra compared to analysis?  Come to think of it, I can't think of many proofs in analysis where induction plays a big role.  One that I could remember was the proof in Rudin that nonempty perfect sets are uncountable, which has an inductive construction, but I'm not sure if that strictly counts as a proof by induction.",WMe6,1hf2wss,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf2wss/proof_by_induction_in_algebra/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hf2wss/proof_by_induction_in_algebra/,2024-12-15 21:30:26,41,0.95,41,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hf2wss
math,Advice for Graduate School Application - Gap Year or Apply Now?,"Foreword: Typically, I would reserve such question for the academic advisors at my school; however, it is winter break, and I'm realizing nobody is looking to talk atm (and understandably so). Being that applications are due before the Spring semester starts back up, I'm stuck w/o many options. So, pls down beat me down with mean comments and heavy downvotes lol! I would appreciate the mercy. Thank you!! :) I appreciate all the help I can get.

~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

Here's my situation: If I took a gap year next year, the benefits would be that I would be able to...

(i) improve GRE scores (math subject test &amp; general test),

(ii) work as a full-time tutor in mathematics (as well potentially fill the role of a substitute teacher for high school math courses),

(iii) prep on getting PhD passes on all four qual courses offered at my university (I have already taken all of these courses, just have yet to take quals),

(iv) have extra time to polish Personal Statement, looking into which universities best fit my interests, etc.

HOWEVER, I am unsure whether (a.) this would be good in ensuring strong letters of rec (most of my options are professors which I've only had one semester under, and asking for a letter of rec an entire year later I'd imagine could cause some difficulties), and whether (b.) graduate schools would frown upon seeing an applicant having taken the most recent year off.

What are your thoughts? Is this a good idea I'm currently considering?

math,Math puzzle: Move the tower,"French mathematician Édouard Lucas was born in Amiens in 1842 and died in Paris 49 years later. He wrote the four-volume work *Recréations Mathématiques*, which became a classic of recreational mathematics. In 1883, under the pseudonym “N. Claus de Siam” (an anagram of “Lucas d’Amiens”), he marketed a solitaire game that he called the Tower of Hanoi.

He claimed that the game was a simplified version of the so-called Tower of Brahma. In this supposed legend, monks had to move a tower made of 64 golden disks in a great temple. Before they could complete this task, however, the temple would crumble to dust, and the end of the world would arrive.

The Tower of Hanoi consists of a small board on which three identical cylindrical rods are mounted. On the left rod there are five disks of different sizes with a hole in the middle. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk at the bottom. The goal of the game is to move all the disks from the left rod to the right rod in as few moves as possible. In each move, only one disk can be taken from one rod and placed on another rod, and a larger disk can never be placed on a smaller disk. How many and which moves are necessary to transport the disks?

math,Bijective function on a bounded set to itself ,"I was wondering if anyone knew if any good functions that can map a bounded set onto itself (for example all integers within a given range to a unique value that same range). I know you could do it with a modulo function, but I think there has to be something more random-appearing. I am trouble finding good results with the terms I can think of for this (such as a bijective endofunction). Of course there are plenty of functions that can do this on an infinite set (such as any order 2 polynomial w/ integer coefficients can do it from its vertex to either side of the number line), but I can’t seem to think of a good way to do it on a bounded set. If there are any good terms to look up or anything like that it would be very much appreciated!
Edit: I realized this can be done in code by just shuffling the set randomly with a seed for reproducibility. I guess a shuffling algorithm is a pretty good way to do it if you have an ordered set, which is my use case",pignated,1heyjzz,https://reddit.com/r/math/comments/1heyjzz/bijective_function_on_a_bounded_set_to_itself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1heyjzz/bijective_function_on_a_bounded_set_to_itself/,2024-12-15 18:14:28,15,0.76,15,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1heyjzz
