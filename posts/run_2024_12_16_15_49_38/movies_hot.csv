movies,The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull opening is one of the weirdest things ever,"Never been a fan of Indiana Jones, didn't grow up on his movies, seen only the first one on TV at some points. Started watching them in order and just finished The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.

So this is the grand return of the character to the big screen and Harrison Ford's return to the role. Indiana Jones always struck me as a less cliched action hero. Sure, there's a pulpy feel to his adventures and they're generally pretty light hearted, but he still feels less like a typical invincible soldier with a machine gun type of an action hero and more of a everyman, an archeology professor who rarely uses his gun, who's not in it for the money or glory, who often gets captured, gets hit during brawls and is afraid of snakes.

And one of the first things he does in this movie is survives a nuclear explosion. Now I've always heard about the fact that Indiana Jones hid from a nuclear explosion in a fridge, but I've thought that it was either a meme I didn't understand or a climactic moment in one of the movies. But no, this is literally happening in an opening, he randomly stumbles upon a nuclear testing site and hides in a fridge to miraculously survive. And then the movie actually starts. Like, due to the law of drama, him being fired due to red scare(isn't 1957 too late for McCarthyism?) feels more dramatic than him living through a nuclear explosion without even breaking a bone from that flying fridge.

I know that this movie is not very well liked by the fans(it is okay-ish, though the CGI is pretty cheap, the nuclear fridge is dumb and also Indy being dumbed down and trusting Mac about ""I've left you to die with the soviets, but I'm actually a double agent"" and then ignoring the fact how he openly thirsts for the treasure in the El Dorado is ridiculous). But I'm curious how did people react to this opening after seeing their favourite hero return.

movies,Lindsay Lohan is phenomenal in The Parent Trap,"
I just watched The Parent Trap for the first time, and she seriously surprised me. She should’ve been nominated for a golden globe, at the very least.

She’s so believable as twins it’s crazy. She gives each of the twins subtle characteristics that make them feel like 2 completely different people. I mean they actually felt like real twin girls, who were separated at birth. The way she gives the one twin certain mannerisms, to distinguish the two apart is so cool. Not a single time during my viewing was I confused at which “twin” was on my screen. The fact that it was her first movie is insane to me. It was a performance way beyond her years. 

Every single line delivery of hers is incredible. Every single joke lands.

There’s a certain scene about 20 mins into the movie, where the 2 girls discover that they’re twins. There’s a specific line that she delivers that absolutely broke my heart, and brought a tear to my eye. She delivers this line with a single tear and a voice crack, and it was fantastic. It’s so subtle, but packs a big punch. Never in a millions years, did I ever think I’d start to tear up watching The Parent Trap, of all movies…

She’s so good, and the movie seriously surprised me. I would definitely watch it again

movies,It's now ten years since Peter Jackson directed a non-documentary film,"The third Hobbit film came out ten years tomorrow, and there's no sign of him directing anything else any time soon.

I think those movies are ever-so-slightly underrated (I stick up for the EEs as the best versions, as unnecessary as an even *longer* version of that story might sound). But it's hard not to think something about their troubled production, and maybe the ways Hollywood has changed over the years, broke something in old PJ.

Not that he hasn't been keeping busy at all. They Shall Not Grow Old was a really good documentary, and Get Back is essential viewing for Beatles fans. Not to mention his part in getting their 'new' song made. He seems happy enough tinkering with his pet interests.

It's a little sad though to think back on when the LOTRs came out and he was gearing up for King Kong and was still in his early 40's, you could imagine he was only just getting started. But now he seems more or less retired as a director and accepting that LOTR is probably what he'll be remembered for.

In a way, that's fair enough. LOTR is more than most people achieve. Still, it would be nice to see him back and doing something new, even if it's just shooting another horror movie in his backyard like he used to talk about doing.",Critcho,1hflaki,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hflaki/its_now_ten_years_since_peter_jackson_directed_a/,2024-12-16 15:14:39,24,0.73,24,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hflaki
movies,"""Constant questioners"" whilst watching a movie - annoying, or no?","I was watching a movie with a friend on the weekend, and he has this IMO extremely annoying habit of constantly asking questions during the movie. Like 'why did they do that?' 'what was that for?' 'what's he planning with that' etc etc.

Suffice it to say, I find this extremely fucking annoying and I told him so in no uncertain terms. His response was to play the victim like ""Man, why so aggressive?"".

The thing is, constant questioners IMO, basically know they're being annoying and do it anyway. We're watching the same movie. We're up to the same point in the movie since we're watching it together. I don't have any knowledge of the movie you don't, unless you weren't paying attention - but even still, that is not on me to rectify for you, you need to pay attention.

And even still, he asks questions I couldn't possibly have the answer for and it's strongly implied the movie will answer them for you anyway as long as you keep watching. Like, why ask me that question when you know I don't know the answer? The movie hasn't given us the information yet but you know it will later!

movies,Neil Breen's Influence on Megalopolis,"Did Neil Breen have an influence on the script for Megalopolis, direct or indirect?

To clarify what I mean, I highlight a number of similarities between Breens work and Megalopolis:
- In Breens movies, every attractive woman wants to sleep with Breen, resulting in a romantic subplot or love triangle. In Megalopolis, Wow, Julia, and Vesta all sleep and/or want to sleep with Ceasar.
- In Double Down, Niel Breen has constant flashbacks to his dead girlfriend. In Megalopolis, there are four random flashbacks to Caesar's dead wife.
- In Breens movies, there are many disjoint plots taking place simultaneously. In Megalopolis, there is the plot between Caesar and Cicero amd the bank takeover plot with Wow and Shia Labeouf to name two.
- In Breens movies, Breen is always endowed with supernatural power. One of the biggest selling points of Megalopolis is that Caesar has the power to stop time among others.
- In Breens movies, the villains/antagonists are corrupt politicians and/or corrupt businessmen. In Megalopolis, the main antagonists are Mayor Cicero and the banker Crassus.

I'm not claiming that Neil Breen wrote the script to Megalopolis. However is it possible that Breens work had an influence on Megalopolis?",Noskcaj27,1hfd060,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfd060/neil_breens_influence_on_megalopolis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hfd060/neil_breens_influence_on_megalopolis/,2024-12-16 06:22:11,21,0.6,21,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hfd060
movies,"I have a soft spot for ""Die Hard 2"" even though I admit it's basically the least of the original three ""Die Hard"" entries.","There's no way, of course, that ""2"" could hope to escape the shadow of the legendary original, but it's also overshadowed by ""Vengeance"" given that features such things as Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson's interplay and Jeremy Irons's terrific villain turn. It plays often like a rehash of the original (even making fun of it, like when Willis asks how it can happen to him twice). The villains are fine, but not anywhere near as memorable as Alan Rickman or Irons. And so on.

But I still really like it as a fun action flick and a worthy successor even if it doesn't quite compare to its predecessor and successor. The setting is great as an airport at Christmas is a fabulous setting for maximum carnage and chaos. Willis still has John McClane in this one as a beleaguered everyman thrown into a situation he didn't expect or want (guy just wants to pick up his wife and get back for Christmas with the in-laws) and we see him at arguably his most vulnerable at certain points. And it keeps the tradition of the first one by having even minor characters be memorable (like the cute Avis clerk who both aids and flirts with John or Holly's Taser-wielding seatmate). I frankly like watching both this and the original at Christmas as a pair for some good holiday-themed action.

I'd also add another aspect that stands out; this is the darkest and most brutal entry in the franchise. Not only does it have arguably the most graphic deaths of the series (see John stabbing the mook Baker through the eye with an icicle or Major Grant getting kicked into the plane turbine), but the villains are genuine terrorists in this one, not just using it for cover. Bill Sadler plays Lt. Col. Stuart as a cold-blooded sociopath with none of Hans or Simon's charisma or likable traits, which makes him arguably the scariest ""Die Hard"" villain (easily the most hatable; Sadler apparently considers it a compliment when people tell him how much they hate the character, because that's what he intended). And worst of all, THEY CRASH A PLANE. A plane with over 200 people on it, including children. And no one makes it out alive.

Because when entering the world of Coco, I felt the wonder of child-me again. I wanted the film to explore every inch of its tale, show me as many parts of its universe as possible and meet more characters to learn about their story.

It was the most innocent but still a very true and sometimes hard hitting story about the meaning of death for both sides, the living and the dead. It's pretty awesome how Pixar managed to get those very dark and adult themes told in a movie mainly aimed at a very young audience. 

Also, the movie looks beautiful. The shadows, the lights and the very strong colours make it a visually pleasing experience. What really caught me off guard was the detail on some characters. The wrinkles on Coco herself are borderline photorealistic.

movies,The Lies (and Deaths) of Christopher Nolan,"I’ve noticed a major plot point in many of Nolan’s movies often revolve around lies and false realities being deployed either selfishly or selflessly. 

Memento is about a serial killer taking advantage of his faded memory and creating a completely false narrative in order to avoid confronting his role in the death of his wife. 

In The Prestige, there is a constant game of lies played between Angier, Borden, Olivia, and Sarah all in the name of one-upmanship and dedication. A film not only about illusions themselves but also the balance of art and relationships, and the obfuscation of the true ugly nature of how these illusions operate and the massive physical and mental toll they take on the performer, such as Angier’s constant suicidal water tank trick, recreating for himself over and over again the same experience that led to the death of his wife.

At the end of The Dark Knight , Gordon and Batman decide to lie to the public about Harvey Dent’s final moments and intentions in order to avoid a scenario where all optimism had disappeared from Gotham. This is mirrored by Alfred choosing to set Rachel’s letter on fire, hoping to avoid an even deeper heart break within Bruce who’s already grieving from her death.

A large plot point in Inception revolves around Cobb making Mal come to terms with the false world they live in, ultimately making her naturally untrustworthy of her surroundings even upon coming back to reality, leading to her (wait for it) death.

Interstellar is in large part about the lies you tell others in order to make them feel safe, such as Coop (dead wife) not being forward with the extent of his mission to his children, Coop not being forward with the extent of his role and fate in the mission over Gargantua to Brand (Hathaway), and Professor Brand (Caine) not being forward with the probability of Plan A ever working. By contrast, the supposedly brave and virtuous Dr. Mann lies about the prospects of his planet in order to save himself at the expense of humanity.

Nolan’s often known for having a fascination with time manipulation and fractured narratives and he also gets a lot of flack for overly theatrical and complicated screenplays but I find his fascination with people’s perceptions and how they either accept fake narratives or create them for others to be what really makes me appreciate him as a writer. Just an unabashed interest in the psychological that I find to be endlessly entertaining.

There was another common plot point that comes up a lot in Nolan’s movies but I can’t remember it now.

movies,"Castle in the Sky by Hayao Miyazaki, a great Japanese animation that was inspired by Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. One of my favorite animated films.","https://preview.redd.it/a4c7wxlm647e1.jpg?width=1678&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=967c5786118484fbeeb2e02ff27f82c84978ee9f

Castle in the Sky (天空の城ラピュタ), also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Laputa is an ancient civilization that once stood so imposing and grand, above all and everyone, but now lies completely deserted and in ruins, surrounded by the environment. Tree roots surround the entire castle, and the human architecture is covered in greenery, with animals and streams running through it. It is as if the natural world is reclaiming what is rightfully its own, and Miyazaki is telling the viewer that the world is not ours, and that humans only have the sense of grandeur that we get because the natural environment allows us to, and that if we are not careful, it may very well pull the rug out from under us and take back what belongs to it.

It was inspired by the book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.

Laputa is a flying island described in the 1726 book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. With an adamantine base, which its inhabitants can manoeuvre in any direction using magnetic levitation. The island is the home of the king of Balnibarbi and his court, and is used by the king to enforce his rule over the lands below.

The film is a strong critic of the use of technology for militarism and the desire for domination. The villain Muska, like Sheeta, is also a descendant of the original inhabitants of Laputa, uses the stone to open a secret gate and assumes power in the flying city. And he desires world control through the power of weapons in Laputa.

The impractical and dangerously authoritative behavior Gulliver details in describing the Laputians is often alluded to throughout Castle in the Sky as the reason for Laputa’s eventual abandonment and ruin. Considering that Miyazaki had read Gulliver’s Travels and often uses his films as a vehicle for political commentary, it would be remiss to dismiss such parallels. Whether intentional or not, Miyazaki effectively adapts warnings regarding absolute sovereignty’s control over scientific innovations to the Cold War era.

Hayao Miyazaki's films, in addition to the beautiful images, are known for criticizing militarism and defending the environment, as happened in the film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which talks about a great war that devastated humanity and the environment.

Whenever my husband is out of town and I’m missing him, I watch this movie and I’ve only just realized it’s because it reminds me of him in a way.

movies,Swiss Family Robinson (1960) - A great adventure and is similar to the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams and Robinson Crusoe.,"Swiss Family Robinson is a 1960 adventure film starring John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran in a tale of a shipwrecked family building an island home. It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss.

The film is not a classic, it is a more naive and fun adventure. It's as if Robinson Crusoe got lost with his family on an island.

The book The Swiss Family Robinson (Der Schweizerische Robinson) is a novel by the Swiss author Johann David Wyss which was inspired by the book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and inspired the series Lost in Space with Guy Williams

The basic story is a husband and wife want to get away from the rat race and are traveling by ship from their home in Switzerland to New Guinea to start a new life. But before they arrive they are caught in a bad storm and are shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. The captain and crew must have seen it coming and deserted early, leaving the family, with three sons, to fend for themselves.

They do the best they can to salvage useful items and supplies from the wrecked ship and set about building their new home. It ends up being a quite elaborate 3-cottage cluster in a very large tree with nicely spread limbs.

The family finds a number of animals, a Tiger, a small elephant, and several others that lead them to think it might be a land bridge, so they build a small boat and set sail to try to go around the island.

movies,A Christmas Prince (2017),"I just watched this Netflix Christmas movie for the first time and it's left me with some questions. 

One, the tiny nation of Aldovia has so many orphaned children they can fill an enormous and stately orphanage. What happened a generation ago to kill all these children's parents? The statue of the late king shows him in military uniform - was he a war hero? When was the war in Aldovia?

The second bit of world building was in the climax of the movie where &gt;!the King's secret note in the acorn Christmas ornament changed the law to allow non-blood relations to still be in the royal line of succession!&lt;. Aldovia has a Prime Minister, which suggests it is a constitutional monarchy, but this plot makes it seem like the king is the head of both the executive AND legislative branches of government. The head of this nation had extraordinary, unchecked power - perhaps the result of the hinted-at civil war?

The last question is about the posh accents of the entire royal family. All of the official royal decrees and ceremonies are held in English. There's no sign of a native Aldovian language. Is Aldovia a colony of the British Empire? What happened to the Native Aldovians and their language? Could this perhaps be the seed of the conflict that led to the former king becoming a war hero, and the leagues of orphans in the care of the state?

I am yet to watch the second and third movies, hopefully they expand on the world building in A Christmas Prince, if not I'd love to hear peoples thoughts about the history of the Aldovan nation state.",batikfins,1hewlkj,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewlkj/a_christmas_prince_2017/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewlkj/a_christmas_prince_2017/,2024-12-15 16:47:52,13,0.7,13,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Spoilers,self,t3_1hewlkj

movies,City of Angels (1998) and correcting a 25 year injustice. ,"This will be kind of  rant but its story time.

When the movie City of Angels came out in 1998 it also had the song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls came out.  This was in the era of MTV still airing music videos and 10 year old me really liked the one for Iris. 

I figured out that it was on the soundtrack for this movie so I tried to rent it at the local movie store, Blockbuster had not yet made it to my town and this was a small mom and pop shop run by a family. 

When they saw the 10 year old boy me trying to rent City of Angels, the guy decided that I would not like this movie and I should rent something else instead.  At the counter he swapped it out for some C tier action flick i dont remember and my mom didn't really seem to care about this. 

So I never got to see it. Years passed and I forgot the title, but occasionally I'd hear that song Iris and remember that there was a movie out there somewhere that I was denied. 

It haunted me. 

25 years later. My fiancee and I are talking about songs we want to play at our wedding.  He turns on the song Iris. This set me on the quest. I could not get past this unforgivable betrayal of a movie I never got to see. 

Finally. I got it. And we are now about to correct a 25 year wrong. 

This got me thinking and I want to ask

movies,I just finished watching all the Rocky movies ,"Holy shit man. These are some of the greatest movies I ever watched. 

The first movie is good, but it is pretty boring I can’t lie. It doesn’t really get all that interesting until the montage and the final fight. But man, something about that fight made it all worth it. I can’t describe it, just watching that iconic montage and fight made it feel like I didn’t waste my time. 

From there the movies just kept on getting better. My favorite one has to be 4. And to be honest I didn’t think 5 was that bad. It was enjoyable and had a good story, the only problem was since it was initially the last movie in the franchise, it would be a pretty bad way to end it. I’m glad they gave Rocky’s story a proper ending with Rocky Balboa (hate that name), which I also thought was a great movie. It had probably the most realistic fight in the whole franchise.

I’ve also just finished all the Rambo movies, and just finished the first Creed movie. All of this is to say that the Rocky movies kick ass and I’m mad at myself for not watching them sooner.

I don't know where to ask such a specific question, and whether it's more suited for a film subreddit or a historical subreddit, but I'll try anyway.

From the first minute of the movie, one shot has this breast star that Patton is wearing. It looks like [The Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown](https://www.identifymedals.com/database/medals-by-period/pre-ww1-medals/the-order-of-merit-of-the-bavarian-crown/). What makes this peculiar is that this is a royal Bavarian order that stopped being awarded after the end of WW1. It is not in the list of awards Patton received nor is Patton in the list of recipients of this award anywhere. Did the film make a mistake here and just put any old decoration? It seems like an odd mistake when they got all his other decorations perfectly correct, and why would they just randomly have this specific royal Bavarian order to put on?",cheese_bruh,1hf5frc,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf5frc/pattons_decorations_in_patton_1970/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hf5frc/pattons_decorations_in_patton_1970/,2024-12-15 23:28:39,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fBAR_s5hyciOOQ0rpj5zaKrmn28QVJROJE6VOSE1bKg.jpg,t3_1hf5frc

William Munny is everything that Clint Eastwood was not in his hey days. He can't mount a horse, he can't shoot straight, his hands shake when holding a gun. In one shot, Clint Eastwood demystified and deglamorized the gun slinger, the cowboy. He stripped him of his super hero status and showed he was some one like us, as vulnerable as could be.

But much before too, the romance behind Wild West, gets busted in the scene where the  sheriff Little Bill( Gene Hackmann), shows the grimy reality to the starry eyed English Bob. English Bob's romantic visions are shattered, when he finds himself face to face with the actual violence, he can't handle it.

https://preview.redd.it/ldzw7xhwlq6e1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aa0d2c215f80f0c576af8e80fa301e9379f207

Characters here don't revel in the violence, they are horrified and appalled by it. The Schofeld Kid and English Bob find reality too uncomfortable to handle. Ned Logan( Morgan Freeman) is more of a pacifist, who wants to opt out of the mission, a decision that proves tragic for him. And William Munny himself is on the mission for some money, rather than any honor.

It is a Western in which there are no heroes and villains per se. William Munny's background is shown to be a sociopath who had no qualms about killing left, right and center. Little Bill while vicious and sadist, is also a God fearing sheriff, who wants to keep the town clean. There are no clear cut black and white, pretty much large swathes of grey.

And it has 3 great actors at the top of their game, Clint Eastwood essentially parodying his own image, just check the scene where he tests his shooting skills. Gene Hackmann as the Sheriff, in a morally ambigous character, you hate him when he tortures Morgan Freeman, but then you see that he just wants to keep the town clean, and will do anything for it.

movies,With AI restorations on the rise in recent years I am becoming worried about the future of movie preservation.,"I will preface this post with something positive before I discuss my concerns. The truth is that as long as there are fans of art there will be people who will properly preserve it. If you want a movie in a particular form/ cut, with the original theatrical audio mix, with every special feature ever released for that movie, and in the best/ least compressed presentation possible then there are many places online where you can access it. This post isn't referring to crazy people like me that will seek out that material. This post is aimed at people that I refer to as “casuals” or the people that aren't as crazy as me about this sort of stuff. The people that just want to watch a movie with the click of a button rather than buying a physical disc or searching for an obscure torrent. 



I want to start my concerns about this phenomenon by stating that I am not a gloomy type of person. I see some of the benefits of AI technology when it comes to movie restorations, but my perspective changed after December 12th, 2024. That day I went with a friend to see a one night only screening of Interstella 5555 (2003). That presentation of the movie is the worst my friend and I have ever seen, which is saying something because that movie is cursed with sub par home media releases. The version that my friend and I saw that day was AI upscaled. It ruined all of the details in the image. Every shot in the movie looked like someone rubbed Vaseline on random parts of the screen. It was pretty much unwatchable. (Here are some examples of what my friend and I saw that night: [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1gfqxge/interstella_ai_remaster/), [Example #2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b_sL6bSRhWw), [Example #3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pX_Ss4BrepE)).



I knew this sort of stuff had happened before like with the recent Blu-ray release of [I Love Lucy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdhJMOTPVw) and the [4Ks that James Cameron has released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxOqWYytypg&amp;pp=ygUXamFtZXMgY2FtZXJvbiA0ayBpc3N1ZXM%3D), however the difference with those is that most of them (except The Abyss) have some other decent release while Interstella 5555 is stuck with a sub par DVD and Blu-ray releases.



Then there is the issue of movies staying in circulation. If this version of Interstella 5555 is the only one available on streaming or a new Blu-ray release then what will “casuals” who have never watched this movie think. Will they think that the movie shouldn't look like that or will they think that the movie is supposed to look like a Vaseline smeared mess?



AI is a very helpful technology for movie restoration but it has become very obvious to me that studios are not using this technology properly and are getting extremely lazy with it. I will put it to you this way, you use a hammer to strike nails and you use a wrench to screw bolts. You can use a wrench to strike nails and you can use a hammer to screw bolts but the tools will do those tasks horribly if used in this manner. Use the right tool for the job and everything will be fine. After that night, I realized that these studios aren't doing that for whatever reason and that it is up to us to keep the art that we love alive.

movies,Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?,"Question, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

I must admit, I've been going on a binge on Warren Beatty films recently and I still can't believe he has done only 23 films. and having done a post before, he has turned down a lot of roles and had some unrealized projects. Looking at his filmography, he was productive from 1961-1975, but after that he became more inconsistent with his projects, pretty much taking years before he does one.

From what I read, Beatty was a bit of a perfectionist and to the detriment of the crew, who takes his time and was go multitude of takes.

I will say, I think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Reds, &amp; Bulworth are masterpieces, and Dick Tracy is fun. However, he is also notable for some real stinkers, Ishtar is middling but it really tanked his image. Town &amp; Country is bad and it pretty much put him into exile and Rules Don't Apply, his comeback, reaffirmed that exile.

Overall, Why was Warren Beatty picky with his film projects?

I didn’t have one of the cases of people singing thankfully, but even that would have been better. I go to the movies once or twice a month, and surely enough every time there’s people who can’t shut their mouths. A comment or two is fine, I’ll lean over to my friend and whisper if I need to, but having entire conversations is absurd. Sometimes people in the back will legitimately have conversations at full volume! I like sitting in the back because it gives me a headache to be super close to the screen, so I guess it’s on me a bit when people around me talk. With that said, I go to a lot of relatively small theatre rooms and I bet anyone could hear it with the volume they’re at. I hate feeling like the asshole when it comes to telling people to be quiet, but sometimes it just comes to that. Today I had to (politely) shush someone and she kind of just scoffed and laughed it off. Later when I left she gave me and the person I was with a totally nasty expression. Like, I’m sorry but how am I the asshole here.

movies,What were the themes of Heretic (2024)?,"I watched the horror movie Heretic last night and I can't say I enjoyed it but I was indeed properly horrified and it's a solid 8/10. 

  
What are the themes? At first, you would think that the script was inspired by a bad date with the annoying kind of atheist who also wouldn't let her leave the apartment. Take that kind of uncomfortable, creepy, scary experience and keep amplifying it until it turns into horror. 

  
Then there's the fact that both actresses were raised Mormon and have apparently distanced themselves from it. I read a few comments from ex-Mormons who said that the movie really resonated with them. And Mr. Reed, as horrible and dishonest as he is, does raise some points about Mormonism which are both true and troubling. I can see how a woman raised in a very conservative religious family would look at the men of her family and be reminded of Mr. Reed. In other words, I think the movie may aim to subtly subvert adherence to high demand, high control religions such as Mormonism. 

  
I'm curious about Mr. Reed's motivations, planning and methods. Why and how does he go about running this house of horror? 

  
I note that Mr. Reed lets slip the occasional weird comment like when he says ""blueberry pie"" instead of ""Lou Gehrig's disease"" in a way that might be seen as mocking her father's death but then he pulls back. What was happening there?

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 5 - Finale,"Hello there,

since more than 50 days, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day (more or less, depending on which time zone you are in) and while this is not This is not quite the end (one country is still missing after this), but I can already draw a first conclusion and have to say: we had our crazy days too. There were days when I could hardly save myself from film suggestions, double nominations and debates about whether a film complied with the rules or not. And there were days when I was mentally on the verge of dropping out because it seemed impossible to find even one film. (Both times I would like to thank the respective participants).

Towards the end, things got particularly strange again in terms of participation: after I was almost criticised for counting the UK as a country and not wanting to have any geographical duplications, the participation rate in the England-thread was still very high and then really dropped. Some people even seemed to be angry that I dared to name Northern Ireland individually - that lead into a shower of downvotes. But I don't want to complain: We have found four candidates for your favorite movie set in the **United Kingdom**.

And this is how it is played: Below you will find four comments from me - these are the respective winners from the individual rounds. The winner is the film mentioned in the comment with the most upvotes (minus downvotes). You may comment on my comments, ***but please refrain from suggesting new films***. The only exception I will accept for this: If there is a UK film that could not be attributed to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, this is an opportunity to put it in the race.

I'm very excited, how this will work out - thanks a lot in advance!

P.S.: Since I'm not able to proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like,",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hewsks,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewsks/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hewsks/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-15 16:56:27,0,0.38,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hewsks

Instead, I prefer to ask myself: among the movies released this year, which one am I most likely to remember 20 years from now? Which ones will be the most memorable? Which one is most likely to make a lasting impression on me?

In my case, #1 this year is very clearly Dune Pt2 (but who knows, maybe in 20 years I'll disagree!). After that it's harder, probably Challengers, maybe Furiosa and Conclave (there are quite a few I have not watched yeet).

movies,What Horror Movie Sub-Genres you’re not a Fan of and Why?,"Horror Movie Sub-Genres I’m not a Fan of and Why are:

Found Footage - Because of the shaky camera and a completely saturated market.

Just way too many low-effort movies in this genre. Similar plots, shaky cameras that doesn't really add anything (except in good ones), and such. The (sub)genre is just filled with too much of garbage, while it's still possible to find a gem

Body Horror 

Demon Possession - Because it’s the exact same movie. And I think a lot of them forget what's actually scary about the idea of demonic possession, which is the thought of not being able to control your own body and the threat of damnation, not just weird contortions and little girls shouting blasphemy with the voice of several grown men.

It's just getting overdone now with little to no innovation in the subgenre. Every single one pretty much feels the same and has a very similar story to tell. 

It always feels predictable, and the religious allusions made in the film are just annoying. It's one of the few horror sub-genres that I can't take seriously.

Initial encounter. Slow build up of strange behavior. Eventual blow up. Speaking in tongues and obscene language unusual for that person. Gets tied down in exorcism. Holy water. Screaming, writhing and contorting. Faith breaks through at the last minute and they're saved! Rinse, repeat. The possessed person always acts the same and the arc of the struggle always feels the same.

Home Invasion - Because a character usually has to do something beyond stupid to let the home invasion happen or they have the upper hand over the invader and don't kill them off until it's too late.",Amber_Flowers_133,1heuh6m,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heuh6m/what_horror_movie_subgenres_youre_not_a_fan_of/,2024-12-15 15:09:25,0,0.36,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heuh6m
movies,The Polar Express - Who is the intended audience?,"I don't think it's made for kids. The dark tone of it and weirdness of certain things seems intentional and is prominent enough that there's no way it could be made for kids. But I also don't think it's made for adults either. There is enough kids stuff in it to make that obvious. I feel like it's more of an art project that doesn't really have a specific intended audience. A movie that tries to capture both the joy and wonder of a kid at Christmastime, as well as the sadness that comes with being an adult longing for that time. 

Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is decent and definitely a holiday classic. And I know there's a whole range of analysis about the story, the characters, the aesthetics, and what it all means. But it kind of seems to occupy its own place among Christmas movies. It has that feel good quality of a deep meaningful Christmas movie. There are some cheerful moments. But it also has this dark melancholic unsettling tone throughout it that you can't ignore. And there are definitely some weird aspects to some of the characters and things that happen. 

I don't think many adults sit down during the holidays to watch this movie. Nor do I imagine anyone putting this movie on for their kid to watch either.

Is there a name for Hollywood making non-isekai movies into isekai (or whatever you wanna call the genre)?  
It's usually the fantasy world comes to Earth, or humans from Earth travel to the fantasy world.

Do you think they do it so the ""average"" cinema goer can enjoy it more, or connect to it?

How do you feel about it? As a fan, and sometimes non-fan.

Whether I like the franchise (Super Mario Bros.) or not (Minecraft), every time I see it, it makes me roll my eyes, and makes me think like it's a lazy way to approach the story.

There are some successful (box office) movies that don't do this, like Detective Pikachu, Dungeons and Dragons, Warcraft, Lord of the Rings, Resident Evil, that don't do this and people still go and watch them.  
(Haven't watched Dungeons and Dragons, and Warcraft, but based on trailers they seem 100% set in their fantasy world).

movies,logistics in get out ,"to start out this is not a complaint post or me trying to get some super clear logic from a fictional movie. there's no way of knowing the answer to my question but I'm curious about others thoughts 

what do folks think that the people who stole black peoples bodies in get out generally did after they had their new body? do we think the community/cult who was in on this had rules on what you did afterwards? clearly they would have to be pronounced as dead otherwise they'd be missing and being white (and wealthy) there would have actually been serious efforts made to find them.

then there's the fact that they'd be seen as black by those who were outwith the group and would therefore have people treat them differently. my theory was that they saw this as an opportunity to sort of retire from society sort of how rose's grandparents were living with their family and posing as staff in the house when others were visiting. I know some people will think it illogical that they'd want to be in black bodies due to the racism in society but personally I think the types of people that were doing this probably held a respectability politics sort of mindset where they'd assume that because they'd act 'proper' they would be fine.

I resonate with some of the points Mr. Pink said, like when he said he'd like to do something about it eg if there's a paper to sign or party to vote, but he seemed generally in disagreement with the society who decided who he should tip or not. 

PS. No hate or disrespect to anyone making a living off those tips, but just want to initiate a genuine conversation.

movies,Get out,"I’m rewatching get out. Jesus. I know we’ve decided already that this movie set the bar too high, which is part of the reason some people feel Jordan’s subsequent movies don’t hold up. But rewatching it only for the second time makes me cold. 
The story presented touches on a topic in racism that always bothered me. The coveting and use of the strengths and abilities black people possess while simultaneously looking at them at no more human than those we aren’t. It’s trippy as fuck to think that they’d believe their mindset in the body of what they believe to be superior genetically would make a better person. It literally speaks to the inability to see the value in our consciousness and that disturbssss me. Roses grandfather losing to Jessie Owens. People at the auction describing how they used to be. The abilities they used to have and comparing them to his. Ugh. 
Roses obsessive need to be on Chris’s side whenever he felt uncomfortable by the weird shit was triggering. Using it as a method to hide his identity and lure him into that false sense of security that he never even really felt was crazy. I never felt more anxious than watching her bring him back into the house once the auction was over. 
And let’s talk about that fucking auction. I think what bothers me most is how sealed Chris fate is at that point . What appears like ignorance to Chris is really also lack of need to hide their true intentions. The way rose brings him around the event to introduce him to everyone , most auctions people move through. Seeing Chris being dragged from group to group, touched and questioned was disturbing to say the least . 
When Chris is having the procedure explained to him I could cry. The sunken place in its entirety is the opposite of what I fear in death. Which is the lack of consciousness. I can’t imagine playing back seat in your own body. I’m not sure how comparative to a vegetative state it is but the trauma in being moved and speaking without your own permission had to be greater than one can imagine. Seeing the color return to the eyes of Andre supports this. While I wish he managed more words lmao it took the rewatch for me to realize he has been essentially raped and used all 
with his knowledge and had no ability to stop it. 
  Rose having a real bedroom with the photos of the people she kidnapped was a choice. I can’t decide  if I appreciated the change in her character upon the reveal but I can say it was entertaining ? The conversation between she and rod and the fact that she had been Chris’s biggest ally during this ordeal. How she went from I love you to smiling during what was supposed to be her death. 
 One thing that always confused me was grandpas  ability to rationalize coming out of the sunken place quick enough to shoot rose and know there’s no way to prevent going back and kill himself. Also rose’s stupidity in not realizing the flash would take grandpa out the sunken place as it had done to Logan hours before. Handing over her gun was .. a choice 😭. Overall I really loved the movie. It was as entertaining as heartbreaking and moving &amp; thought provoking. I choose to believe since the other ending wasn’t the Final Cut it just doesn’t exist.

movies,Brian De Palma's Legacy,"Brian De Palma has directed some of the most iconic films such as Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables, and the first Mission Impossible. And yet he does not seem to be as talked about compared to the other New Hollywood filmmakers(Coppola and Scorsese for instance). He took advantage of the technical aspects of filmmaking such as using split screens and tracking shots in his films. However, from what I have read and seen, he seems to be a rather divisive figure in Hollywood. In addition to the surprising amount of Razzies he's been nominated for, many see him as style over substance and a major Hitchcock ripoff in many of his flicks. Others take issue to the gratuitous sex and violence as well.

movies,Educating Rita is the most beautiful film about self-determination and friendship,"So Educating Rita (1983) sees Blood Brothers author Willy Russel's updated take on the classic George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. He really subverts the narrative into something special and important. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are just phenomenal and arguably at their very best, as the middle class professor and his working class student, who also works as a hairdresser, in the 1980s. He is teaching her how to pass a literary course, with the narrative building up towards that final exam.

The three key themes I identified were self-determination, friendship, and social class dynamics. 

Now, Pygmalion is the classic tale of a working-class woman being educated and transformed into a member of upper class society by a wise professor.

The ending is quite dark, and it makes a point of how Eliza Doolittle feels she has lost her identity and it's exceedingly bleak. This was famously changed into a happy ending for the wonderful and far more famous musical My Fair Lady. Both have their charms , but I'll take the politically charged Pygmalion any day.

Now, what I love about Pygmalion is Russel kind of flips the roles on a psychological level. Caine's professor character Frank is far more vulnerable than hard-nosed Rita. He struggles with alcohol addiction and Rita's transformation kind of breaks him. He can't stand losing her, what she was (his pet project), as he's so unhappy in his life, otherwise.

Throughout the movie we see Rita taking more control over her life and doing what she wants instead of what society expects of her. She ditches the oppresive husband who wants a baby and breaks out of her shell to become a popular and highly regarded student at the university. She smashes the exam and gets a distinction. 

In an absolute Tour de Force of a monologue, Rita explains why she decided to carry on down that path. She explains that she had 'a choice' and made it, after considering it. She then talks about all the potential she has now the exam is over and how she can choose to do pretty much anything she likes and doesn't feel held back like before. A complete 180 from the Rita we saw at the start.

In both characters, Russel is exploring the idea of self-determination. Frank makes every wrong decision and falls apart as the film progresses. And Rita seems to make every right one.

Through this journey, we also explore their friendship amid the backdrop of the middle and working class dynamics in 1980s Liverpool (you couldn't pick a better time or setting to explore this). 

Throughout the movie, you get a whiff of palpable romance but I think that's just because Walters and Caine's chemistry is just so good. At the very end, the characters look like they may kiss as they're about to embrace to say goodbye, but no, thankfully they give eachother a nice big hug.

Frank takes a bold new step and transforms his life by jetting off to Australia. 

Then, in the final shot, Rita is walking off down the corridor. In an earlier scene, Frank implored Rita to come with him. Rita turns and looks back, you can tell she's thinking about going. But then she decides to carry on striding forward to make her own way in life.

movies,Rewatched Mad Max: Fury Road. I don’t get the hype,"I watched *Mad Max: Fury Road* about a month ago. I thought it was really cool and a good movie overall. Soon after, I checked its critic scores and was blown away by how high they were. I read up on people's opinions about it and it was just non-stop praise. Like yeah, It was good, but THAT good?! I went back and watched it again. 

I still don't get it.

OK before this gets downvoted into oblivion, I DO get why people like this movie; I like it too!! The pacing and choreography is insane, clever and subtle feminist themes, and everything done practically made for a great and more engaging viewing experience.

BUT

Is it really THAT good? I mean character development is kind of non-existent and I never really felt connected to any character or cared about what happened to them (I also never watched a Mad Max movie before, but I feel my criticism is valid), it lacked substance, and it was so abundant with and reliant on action that it never felt like the stakes were high, and scenes without action felt empty and stilted.

I understand that the movie puts less emphasis on certain aspects because it knows what it wants to be; I actually think that this kind of self-awareness in a film is rare and extremely important in putting a good project together. However, when people say that this is THE BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER MADE, I have to be harsh!

I don’t really want to argue (ok maybe a little), I want to hear from you guys on why this movie gets the praise it does and where I might be missing it.

TLDR: Everyone say movie is best movie. Me no see how movie is better than good movie.

this is the fourth (or third, depends on what status you grant Northern Ireland) time I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a country in the country called UK. After England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's now **Wales**' turn before the grand finale. As always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"Depictions that were considered historically or scientifically accurate at the time, but not anymore due to later discoveries","Movies don't always strive for historical or scientific accuracy, but sometimes they do, only for new information to emerge later that changes the academic consensus and it turns out it wasn't actually accurate after all.

For example, back in the day, historians mostly accepted that the Titanic sank whole (some witnesses had insisted that it had split in two though, but it was dark and hard to see so their testimonies were considered unreliable). As such, movies used to depict it sinking in one piece. But in 1985, the wreckage of the Titanic was discovered and it was proven that the Titanic had split in two, and as such movies released afterwards, especially the James Cameron movie, have depicted sinking it accurately.

The public perception of dinosaurs mostly comes from what we've seen in movies, and a lot of it is because of Jurassic Park . The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park mostly looked like what scientists thought that dinosaurs looked like at the time. But in the decades since, it has been discovered that dinosaurs probably had feathers. Despite this, newer Jurassic Park movies still depict most dinosaurs as not having feathers, and so do most movies with dinosaurs really, it's just what audiences are used to at this point.

movies,Smile 2 (2024) My expectations where tripled what I expected! What did you think of the film?  ,"WARNING! Naturally, spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, do not proceed. 



&gt;!Ever since the first film, I jumped on reddit almost as fast as did with the sequel now, giving it heavy praise. I was shocked a good portion thought it was kind of laughable. The scares are important sure, but what Smile 2 provides is just unsettling anxiety. Thankfully the ammount of jump scares were JUST enough but not too much, which I admit the first film might of had just a little too much of. For example, when Skye (Naomi Scott) looked in her closet there was a dozen of people she knew smiling at her. I thought ""ok any moment they will rush and the movie goes on"" They rushed alright. But they just got closer. The scene which was less than a minute felt like a eternity. I was so uncomfortable (in a good movie way) I was just thinking common man what what WHATS gonna happen"". Then they get even closer but stacked on top each other. Honestly that made me smile in real life and giggle for a slight moment. The acting in this movie is superb. Naomi Scott was brilliant. I couldn't help thinking how hard it must of been to act it all out, but she brilliantly executed her performance. She made it feel so realistic. There was two jaw dropping (and i mean literally) moments in the film where i stood still silent in awe. The very beginning when Joel got hit by the car in the beginning. But better yet, the f&amp;$%ing ending! The moment I realized reality set in realizing 7,000+ people are about to all get the curse, DUDE I just instantly imagined a sequel for a world apocalypses movie lol. !&lt;

movies,I honestly like the other Terminator films after T2 because the likeness of Judgement Day but in different formats is a part of the Terminator franchise.,"I am thinking that I am one of the few people here who acknowledges this but I feel that every Terminator film, even after the ones of T2, bring something new to the concept of Judgement Day.

Sure, every single one brings the same concept of T2 over and over again (Dark Fate does not have John but it is still the same concept with the new character) but I think that this is intentional.

Since the very beginning with T1, there has been the concept about the debate between free will and determinism where the Kyle Reese goes back in time to save Sarah but he impregnates her with John and the result is the photo that she gets in the future. 

Because of this, Judgement Day still happens but it was delayed.

The same goes for T2 with the concept of 'No Fate' which apparently shows the dilemma between free will and the determined future where the characters still are able to prevent Judgement Day but it is delayed until a new Terminator comes.

This eerily reminds of the game Bioschock Infinite which shows the concept of Infinite universes and the idea behind constants and variables which basically says that even though the timing of the event did not come, it will still come in different forms and it is still a constant - hence, the determined need to bring  Judgement Day.

So in a way, T3 is still the same like the previous films except Judgement Day still happened meaning that not even John could escape his fate.

In Genysis, I liked the idea of trying to blend a little bit of the butterfly effect where even though Judgement Day was prevented, Skynet took a new format and I liked the parallel where we have become so dependent on technology that we have become slaves to it.

So that concept of technology being a literal threat and a literal idea that is possible was a good concept.

Same goes for Dark Fate.
Sure, the writing could have been handled better instead of just killing John at the very beginning

But I think I understood the idea behind Legion because it is still Skynet but with a different name.

From my perspective, it was just another manner of the butterfly effect. Skynet still exists and will exist in the future but somehow, the butterfly effect makes it have a different name but the intention is still determined.

The only thing that I really did not like it how the Terminator that killed John somehow developed empathy towards humanity without the proper programming and has basically maintained a relationship for years without his family never questioning his literal existence.

I just do not understand when people criticise when they expect something different than T2 because from my understanding, T2 is bound to happen over and over again in different formats.

Or the fact that people want something different because the other films are indeed different but are still the same story with different details and chapters but still telling the same story overall.",sammyjamez,1heq335,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1heq335/i_honestly_like_the_other_terminator_films_after/,2024-12-15 10:42:00,0,0.26,0,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1heq335

It’s about the relationship between a white cop and a black cop that become friends over the course of the movie.

Netflix is basically the old “straight to dvd“ but now it’s straight to streaming, which I guess makes sense given the climate of entertainment these days…. But most of the memorable movies for me have premiered in theaters or get a justified release…

movies,Actors you may not have realised were British,"I want to mention five British actors that I didn't know (at least, not consciously) were British when I first saw them onscreen. Please add your own!

1. Hugh Laurie

Not everyone grew up watching British film and television and saw Hugh Laurie in his earlier roles—and even then, depending on your generation, you may not have recognised him when he became popular in American media (I didn't, at least). If your first exposure was his role as Stuart Little's dad in the movie of the same name; or as House, MD in the popular hospital drama; you might be forgiven for thinking he was an American actor.

2. Gary Oldman

A man of many faces (and voices), Gary Oldman has been in so many blockbuster movies—and is often touted as an example of characters who looked familiar but you just couldn't quite put your finger on who was playing the part... From Zorg in The Fifth Element to Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman trilogy, it may have come as a shock to some people to see (and hear) him as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter franchise.

3. Gillian Anderson

I'm a huge X-files fan. In fact, for the last year or two I have been doing a\[nother\] rewatch! Growing up, I had no idea that Gillian Anderson was a British actor. She played the part of Dana Scully so well (in my opinion), I am sure many were hoodwinked into thinking she was another fantastic American television actor.

4. Henry Cavill

Before he played Geralt of Rivia, Henry Cavill showed up in all sorts of places; but his notable role was Clark Kent / Kal-El in the mid 2010s movie, Man of Steel. At the time, I had no idea he was British. Henry's a real nerd (self-proclaimed, like many of us), and I look forward to his upcoming involvement in Warhammer 40K. :)

5. Tom Holland

This man. He's becoming quite legendary. If you haven't seen The Crowded Room, I highly recommend that you check it out. Bursting onto the screen\* as Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War (and then of course the Spiderman movies which followed), I would hazard a guess that many fans were oblivious to the fact that Tom's a Brit. He nailed the part of Nathan Drake in 2022's Uncharted.

\* Before anyone comments that ""bursting onto the screen"" implies an actor's debut, I am aware that Tom Holland played roles prior to Peter Parker. But it wasn't until then that by all accounts his popularity began taking hold. There's no arguing it was pretty bursty, right?

Bonus: Kaya Scodelario

I sat down recently and started watching Guy Ritchie's Netflix show, The Gentlemen. If you haven't seen it, stop reading Reddit and go fire it up. It borders on hilarious, with all the Guy Ritchie grit and wit you would expect. Anyway, there is a ""businesswoman"" called Susie Glass (rhymes with arse, not ass). It took me a minute to figure out where I'd seen her before—except she didn't have a British accent. If you've seen the Maze Runner movie trilogy, you'll know what I'm talking about: Kaya played Teresa, a major part in all three films, and it was a real trip to realise that she's actually British.

1. The dark knight Christian bale and heath ledger that’s all I got to say heath ledgers joker is the best villain in a movie I’ve ever seen hands down Christian bale also the best bat man won’t see anything like this anytime soon for sure 

2. Avengers infinity war/ end game tie too hard to pick this one end game is just an incredible rollercoaster with the craziest plots and to see all those characters with eachother is just genius. 

3. Spider man 2. Spider man 1 was great but I just feel like this is just the best spider man there is Tom Holland is great but you just can’t beat tobey maguire it takes every thing from spider man 1 and just improves it 

4. Iron man now this really exceeded my expectations it’s very realistic emotional and action packed and funny and you don’t see that combo in most super hero films.

movies,Kubo and the Two Strings is an unbelievable achievement in filmmaking ,"Just watched Kubo and the Two Strings, a masterpiece from Laika – the stop-motion studio that gave us Coraline, Paranorman and Missing Link. I can’t believe this movie is real. I’m watching behind the scenes videos in awe of how the characters we see were indeed physical figures whose limbs were moved a fraction of a fraction of an inch by the animators.

Stop motion is insane by itself, but if we look at the works from Aardman - the creators of “Chicken Run” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit” (which I love, btw) – we can see the movements are not as fluid, and that’s part of their charm. Not to mention the LEGO movies, whose characters are stiff by nature. Kubo’s characters, on the other hand, are so fluid they look like CGI. (In fact, they used a lot of CGI for the backgrounds, and the movie was nominated for a VFX Oscar - the only animated film besides Nightmare Before Christmas to get this distinction.)

Also stop motion characters are usually dressed in tight clothes and have steady hairdos to make them easier to animate – but in Kubo, they’re using kimonos and have long hair; plus, there are animal characters and one of them is a MONKEY with fur. That means the animators had to move the kimonos and each hair strand (or the fur, in the monkey’s case) individually for every frame. And they placed that monkey in the middle of a snowstorm!!! They had to manipulate every single piece of that fur 24 times to end up with a second of footage.

Kubo is a very touching and beautiful film too, and I recommend it for its storytelling appeal as well. But I’m mostly here to praise the achievement by itself. Seriously, I couldn’t believe my eyes.",miggovortensens,1hd4puo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hd4puo/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_unbelievable/,2024-12-13 04:49:39,735,0.93,735,0,64,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hd4puo

With the 10 year anniversary of Interstellar happening recently, a few friends and I decided to rewatch the movie and WHOLY COW did I forget how many Oscar and other award winners there are in the film.

For those who don't remember, here's the main cast of the film listed in order according to Wikipedia:

* Matthew McConaughey (Academy Award winner)
* Anne Hathaway (Academy Award winner)
* Jessica Chastain (Academy Award winner)
* John Lithgow (No Oscar but 6 Emmys, 2 Golden Globes, a BAFTA and 4 Grammys)
* Michael Caine (2 Academy Awards)
* Casey Affleck (Academy Award winner)
* Timothee Chalamet (Academy Award nominee, almost certainly will win one soon)

Matt Damon (Academy Award winner) also has a small part in the film. Essentially everyone who plays a major role in the film is an Oscar winner, can't remember the last time that happened in a modern film. Not to mention the movie is obviously directed by Christopher Nolan who is also an Oscar winner, just an unbelievable collection of talent.

movies,Anyone else suspect that Elf One was reviewed so poorly because critics are kinda tired of The Rock?,"This is a total hot take, and I'll admit that I'm pretty much done with Dwayne Johnson's recurring vanity character (a larger-than-life pile of muscle and ego), but what got me thinking about this is the disparity on Rotten between the critics (roughly 35%) and the audience (about 95%).

So I'm wondering if the critics may have been a little more kind had another actor played his part, and if the general movie going audience also thinks this a possibility. Even if youre a fan, you gotta admitt . . . he's pretty much taken over the 'family-friendly tough guy' role.

And I understand why, I was even into it at first, but now I'm just kinda bored.

* Man From Nowhere
* John Wick
* Good Will Hunting

one of my favorite parts of the movie is when the train arrives at the north pole. they made the very smart decision to have the polar express theme play at that part. it's a really good song with great lyrics and a fast pace that mirrors the fast pace of the titular train.

when you listen to the soundtrack on a CD or a vinyl or on Spotify or however you listen to it, the version of the song on the soundtrack is different. in the soundtrack version, they have tom hanks as the conductor randomly interjecting. and to me, this ruins the song.

for starters, as talented as he is, tom hanks cannot sing. or maybe he can. i don't really know because he isn't so much singing as he is sing talking. also, like i said, he randomly interjects and i feel that it ruins things.

He was gone for 16 years Frodo doesn't look any older and very easily could have had an entire life with a wife and kids by the time Gandalf came back.  The editing of this sequence as well as my lack of understanding of the story from the books meant that this fact about the plot of the movie blew me away and changed a lot of the context of that part of the movie for me. 

Another one is Once upon a time in Hollywood.  The plot is chugging along, then right at the end of act 2 a narrator comes in and says how several months have passed, Leo's character has left to film spaghetti westerns got a girlfriend etc. It just felt so sudden and kinda unnecessary

movies,Are We Supposed to Believe the Actor Is the Character?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about acting and how we experience it as an audience. When I watch a movie, am I supposed to believe the person playing the part is the character they’re portraying? Or is it enough to just see the actor doing their job—sometimes really well—but never fully disappearing into the role?

Take Timothée Chalamet, for example. I haven’t seen his Bob Dylan portayal yet, but when I do, am I supposed to feel like I’m watching Bob Dylan? Or will it just be Timothée doing a solid impression of Dylan? Similarly, with Adam Driver, I really like the guy and his work, but I’m always aware it’s Adam Driver. Whether he’s yelling about the Rebellion in Star Wars or breaking down in Marriage Story, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s him delivering a great performance, not me being fully immersed in the world of the character. DDL became Daniel Plainview for example. I know I know DDL is like fucking insane but shit, he raises the bar. 

Shouldn’t great acting make me forget the actor entirely? Shouldn’t I feel transported—like I’m in a dark IMAX theater, alone, completely immersed in the story and the character? Or is that asking too much? Maybe it’s enough to just appreciate the craft, even if I never fully lose sight of the actor behind it.

I’d love to hear how others feel about this. Do you find yourself believing in the character, or are you always aware of the actor? Is there a specific performance where you did feel like the actor completely disappeared? Or is that level of immersion more about the movie as a whole than the acting itself?",spacepants1990,1he7zbp,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1he7zbp/are_we_supposed_to_believe_the_actor_is_the/,2024-12-14 17:37:33,0,0.19,0,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1he7zbp

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 3 - Scotland,"Hello there,

I've really been on a Reddit journey through filmed Europe for quite a while now and yes, it makes me wistful that it's coming to an end... but it's going to get wild here at the end. I've arrived at U, and I have to say: Sorry, UK, but this concept of a country made up of several countries is just confusing and I'm in favour of any (non-violent) way to clean up this mess somehow.

But since I don't want it to become too political, I've come up with an idea: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will each have their own thread and at the end the overall UK winner will be chosen from the individual winners. England and Northern Ireland are now more or less through and today we are looking for movies set in **Scotland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes films can be set in several countries, but the larger part should be set in the country we are looking for.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

P.S.: As I can't proclaim a UK winner yet, I'll refrain from attaching the otherwise always updated list of winners at this point and instead would like to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) \- please don't hesitate to give it a like!",Impossible_Werewolf8,1hdfvxo,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdfvxo/favorite_movie_by_european_country_united_kingdom/,2024-12-13 16:22:45,3,0.56,3,0,55,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdfvxo

movies,Best realistic fights in movies? Bonus points for martial arts focused films ,"I was recently watching the latest batch of Cobra Kai episodes and thought that this show has jumped the shark for some time now. Sure the original Karate Kid movies are over the top and cheesy as hell but the whole appeal of this series was that it brought it all down to Earth and made them feel almost believable, like they could have happened. But they couldn't help themselves from leaning into cheesy, overly choreographed movie karate/tae kwon do. 

That got me thinking, what are  some movies that have a lot of fighting in them that remain somewhat grounded? No over the top kung fu, no fake martial arts. Just technical fighting and good cinematography to sell it. I could think of some examples, like last year's ""The Killer"" which was sort of an anti John Wick film, with fight scenes without jumping around, no telegraphed swings, no spinning kicks or anything, just people mostly shoving/punching/grappling until someone wins. I couldn't however for the life of me think of a martial arts focused movie that manages to remain grounded somewhat.

Most people who can pull stuff like that off are comedians so they are quick witted and usually pretty funny, but I'm curious if there has been any movies or possibly TV shows where from the plot is not comedic and the lines are mostly made up.

movies,"How much ""profit"" does a movie have to make to actually be profitable?","I've seen movies that made $30 million in ""profit"" against a budget of $150 million be considered a ""commercial flop"". 

I've read that a film's budget should be doubled to account for marketing costs, so that $100 million budget film that made $300 million actually resulted in a $100 million loss. 

That can't be a rule of thumb, right? I always figured the ""double for marketing"" only applied to the tentpoliest of tentpole movies. 

An example: A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004) grossed $211 million on a budget of around $140 million. Going by the double for marketing rule, that's a horrendous box office failure. Even if you stake out a half for marketing rule for mid-level productions, the film barely broke even. 

But there was at one point in time a sequel in the works. I wouldn't think they'd entertain the idea of a sequel if the first one barely broke even at best or blew $150 million at worst. So the oft-stated double for marketing rule or half for marketing rule that I just made up couldn't possibly apply to this film, right?

It's not as if this film came out in the 2020s, when studios were trying to status-quo their way through the post-pandemic film industry shakeup. Duds were still duds in the early 2000s when this film came out. 

So how exactly does profit work in Hollywood? Not everyone can be Paranormal Activity or Avengers: Endgame, and we've all seen movies that made a couple milly in profit get 3 or 4 sequels. It's clear they made enough money from the first one to warrant sequel(s), so a multiple of the production budget for marketing is not a universal rule.",Danielnrg,1hdr76o,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdr76o/how_much_profit_does_a_movie_have_to_make_to/,2024-12-14 00:58:58,0,0.44,0,0,32,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hdr76o

movies,Mother! As interesting a movie as I've ever seen. I thought it really showed of the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence. How did you view this movie?,"I went into Mother! knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it starred Jennifer Lawrence. I watched it cold. I thought to myself Jennifer Lawrence is everywhere on social media, TV interviews, Insta Reels, and of course movies.  I thought to myself I will know if it is a good movie or not base on whether or not I become absorbed in it and forget that it's Jlaw acting in it. Well about a tenth of the way through I realized she was completely absorbed by the role. And the weirder the movie got the more she, the actress, disappeared into it. At first, as things got more and more out of hand, I thought it could turn out to be a weird dark comedy. But things never stopped getting out of hand. Every time I thought it had gone too far, it went even further. It literally took me to the very end to figure out what was going on and even then I had missed a lot of the message. I can tell I liked it and it was a good movie because I'm still thinking about it. Man what a ride it was! I'm dying to hear other people's thoughts and reactions to this movie.

Edit: Interesting. This appears to be a movie one either loves or hates. Very little middle ground. The vast majority of movies are unable to generate this kind of response - creating such a divide. That says something. Most movies I watch are just diversions, forgotten about the next day like a finished comic strip. This one lingers, generating strong feelings one way or another. That seems to me one of the defining qualities of art. So, if nothing else this movie is art.

movies,The Most 80's 80's Movie,"Threads like this have been done before but I have some stipulations to add. 

  
I figure the most 80's 80's movie HAS to have a montage. It also has to feature what the 80's looked like at the time. And finally it should have a big name musician headlining the soundtrack with a song for the film. 

  
So, for example....

  
Back To The Future is a super 80's movie, but mostly it takes place in the 50's. Doesn't have a montage but does have The Power Of Love. 

  
Top Gun is a super 80's movie, has Danger Zone, don't think it has a montage but mostly takes place on the ocean and in the air, with the exception of a bar. It's not really set in a place that looks ""80s""

  
But Rocky 4..... this movie has 3 montages, has James Brown headlining the film with Living in American, and takes place in big cities and casinos with blondes with big knockers, robots, fluorescent lights. LOOKS like the 80's up in there.

\- Gerard Butler's Big Nick eats a donut from a crime after his wife kicks him out.

\- The movie does a great job at highlighting how much the criminals have to lose if they fail (50 Cent's character especially).

\- The heist sequence mines tension out of the simplest moments, such as cops asking the criminals (who are posing as cops) for ID. It shows that bureaucratic procedures can be just as nail-biting as gunfights. 

\-Butler's character follows Pablo Schneider's to a gun range and they show off their shooting skills to each other. After Schneider shows up in Butler's apartment, smiles, and walks out. It's a fun way of showing that they're on to each other.

  \- It recreates the Heat diner scene but moves it to a BBQ joint, but instead of having cops and robbers have meaningful conversations about life, they just antagonize each other.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/marvel-movies/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (50):

&gt;Though closer in quality to Morbius than Venom, Kraven is far from a catastrophe and serves up a decent helping of bloodthirsty, globe-trotting action. Taylor-Johnson makes a muscular if self-satisfied protagonist in a film that would have been better off standing on its own shoeless feet than cravenly (or should that be, 'kravenly') cleaving itself to its comic book brethren.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review-1235075341/) (C-):

&gt;Immune to fan response, impervious to quality control, and so broadly unencumbered by its place in a shared universe that most of its scenes don’t even feel like they take place in the same *film*, “Kraven the Hunter” might be very, very bad (and by “might be” I mean “almost objectively is”), but the more relevant point is that it feels like it was made by people who have no idea what today’s audiences might consider as “good.

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/) (50):

&gt;After nine years, Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns to Marvel superhero fare, but while Kraven the Hunter has potential, it's a middling origin story.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1735558/kraven-the-hunter-movie-review/?taid=6759efc37ea5c90001a8bc6e&amp;utm_campaign=feed&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=TWX-BP-SlashFilm) (50):

&gt;Sony, still possessing the film rights to Spider-Man, decided to make an interconnected Spider-Man Villain universe, of which ""Kraven the Hunter"" is the final chapter. Watching Chandor's film, though, one can see that neither the studio nor the filmmakers are interested in starting anything anymore. There is no presumption that fans will be interested in long-form mythmaking, and sequel teases remain light. This allows ""Kraven"" to be stupid on its own. And, in a weird way, that's a relief. We're free.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/kraven-the-hunter-review-russell-crowe-busts-up-laborious-superhero-yarn) (2/5):

&gt;Crowe’s safari-going Russian oligarch is the main redeeming feature of this Spider-Man-adjacent tale but there’s not much to like elsewhere

[The A.V. Club](https://www.avclub.com/kraven-the-hunter-review) (67):

&gt;Kraven The Hunter gets closer than any of its predecessors to understanding the silly, entertaining freedom of shedding continuity. Then again, maybe it’s best that this misbegotten series quits while it’s just-barely ahead.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/kraven-the-hunter-review-aaron-taylor-johnson/) (1/5):

&gt;If you thought Morbius and Madame Web were bad, the extended Spider-Man Universe hits a new rock bottom with this diabolical entry

[Collider](https://collider.com/kraven-the-hunter-review/) (3/10):

&gt;*Kraven the Hunter*'s bland storytelling, subpar acting, and staggering technical issues are proof that the *Spider-Man* IP needs to be protected before it becomes an endangered species.

Directed by J.C. Chandor:

&gt;Kraven has a complex relationship with his father which sets him on a path of vengeance and motivates him to become the greatest and most feared hunter.

If I would've watched the trailer - I already know he did something bad, I already know he's on jury duty for the bad thing he did and someone innocent can go to jail, I know people will find out, I know he confesses to Kiefer Sutherland's character, I know he'll eventually raise suspicions...only thing left for me in the movie is the verdict lol.


Not watching the trailer all I knew it's just some courtroom drama.


If you didn't see it yet, don't watch the trailer cause it's a pretty clever plot twist the trailer gives away.

movies,Nickel Boys review,"Nickel Boys: 

Boy oh boy, where do I begin. They told RaMell Ross that he wouldn’t pull this off, that people wouldn’t adapt to the style. Well I’m here to tell you, they were dead wrong. Nickel Boys is creatively astounding. Movies that are so unique don’t come around often and this is unique with a capital U. 

The cinematography is the obvious place to start here. This is an experiment that passes with flying colors. Every frame will be burned into your brain that you’ll see them when you close your eyes. This camera work is like nothing I’ve seen ever seen before and it’s executed to sheer perfection. 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure detail and effort that pays off massively. Don’t take your eyes off the screen cause not a single frame can be missed. Nickel Boys is a vision of artistic excellence. 

Onto the acting. Credit to all the actors and actresses involved cause they were all in danger of being over shadowed by the creative choices made, but man oh man do they hold their own. Pure emotion on display. A gripping but grounded tale. 

RaMell Ross is cinema’s Einstein. Everything about Nickel Boys is innovative and inspired, a truly staggering cinematic achievement. I felt like I was witnessing cinema history… I’m not saying it’s for everyone and Nickel Boys is a movie that will inevitably divide audiences. That said I think this movie is generational, and you can say I’m taking the bait but I have never witnessed something on this scale before and I’m deeply elated with what I have seen. 

Nickel Boys = 10/10

This is my first post on here and this might be a case of recency bias, but I just watched my 100th movie of the year and it was my first watch of Sideways (2004).

I believe 2004 was a good year for movies, but when I went on IMDb, I was kind of shocked to find out that Paul Giamatti wasn’t even nominated for his role in the movie. 

But regarding Best Picture award, admittedly, it’s been a while since I’ve seen The Aviator, Finding Neverland, and Million Dollar Baby, (haven’t seen Ray yet)but between Sideways and Million Dollar Baby (the Oscar winner), what do you think is the better movie? And why?

movies,What are your thoughts on watchmen chapter 1 and 2 is it a perfect adaptation ,"The animated Watchmen chapters I and II are a true love letter to the original graphic novel, staying incredibly faithful to the source material. The visuals capture the gritty, noir-like atmosphere of the comic perfectly, and the animation brings the artwork to life in a way that feels close to the original. The pacing mirrors the comic’s episodic structure, and the dialogue stays true to the sharp, complex exchanges that define the characters.

While this faithfulness will undoubtedly resonate with long-time fans, it also raises an interesting question: is it too faithful? The adaptation feels almost like a direct retelling, which can leave little room for new interpretations or creative risks. For those familiar with the comic, it offers a nostalgic experience, but does it stand out as something more than just a faithful retelling? Could it have pushed boundaries or expanded on themes in a way that feels fresh? It nails the essence of Watchmen, but does something still feel missing?

For numerous reasons my wife and I rarely go see a movie at the theater. We’ve often wondered if studios might eventually release some movies for home viewing on the same day that they are released at the theaters. We’ve seen this happen before, but I don’t remember it happening with very many high profile movies. They could charge $50 or so and we would still be interested. I understand that they might be afraid of losing  revenue but there are people like myself that are not going to the theater who would be providing additional income. I also understand the desire and need to support movie theaters so I’m sure that would be a big consideration. I’m not suggesting they do it with every movie. Maybe just occasionally.

movies,Alternate ending to Turning Red ,"I used to love Turning Red but I don't anymore. When I washed it for the second time the flaws in it became a lot more visible:

If the concert was happening on the 25th instead of the 18th, how did May and her friends go so long thinking it was the 18th? Did they not double check? Do nobody tell them?

If they stopped being friends for a while, why did Miriam keep Mei's pet toy?

Why did they suddenly love Tyler if he was a 4*Townie? Just because he likes the same band as them doesn't mean he's a good person.

Keeping these flaws in mind, here is how I would have done it:

At the party, Mei and her friends (Miriam, Priya, and Abby) hear that 4*Town's Toronto concert has been cancelled. Mei attacks Tyler after he insults her family and doesn't stand up for her friends when her mother blames them for everything. The ritual goes off without a hitch and her red panda form is sealed away.

When Mei returns to school the following Monday, she is shunned by her former friends, who are still mad at her for throwing them under the bus. She is heartbroken until Tyler approaches her and apologizes for his past behaviour. Mei extends an offer of friendship, which he gladly accepts, and the film ends with the two walking happily into the sunset.

But my IMAX is with Laser and I just saw War of the Rohirrim on it. 

So I'm deciding which screen is best for Superman. (Superman is my favorite superhero and character so that's why I'm preparing so early) Superman is being shot on IMAX and will most likely have a bigger aspect ratio for the entire film or specific action scenes. 

I like ONYX because of the LED screen, better color, brighter, and higher resolution. Though I don't like that the cinema with the ONYX screen has in person waitress so they are just walking in front of you while the movie plays.

movies,2025 might be one of the most interesting years for mainstream cinema and maybe a new creative resurgence in filmmaking.,"The last 5 years honestly had been probably one of the roughest eras in mainstream cinema creatively and  as far as what was getting made and how they were being treated particularly as far as theatrically released or original mid budget movies goes.

And part of the fact was covid's impact towards the film industry and led up to the major studio's  misguided push towards streaming and the Netflix route of ""throwing whatever at the wall and seeing what sticks and not give a lot of marketing into while the execs and shareholders who greenlight these movies get all the nice fat checks  in the world. I think it's starting to die out a little bit though thankfully.

 Like guys remember 8-Bit Christmas on HBO max? or the Chip n Dale movie on Disney+? What about No One Will Save You on Hulu? that one movie that a lot of genre fans raved about the week it came out  only to feel like it was buried afterwards and used as filler for a streaming service? *crickets chirping*

But anyway that the majority of  theatrical mainstream movies and the  industry leaned towards a more toxically nostalgic shift  for reboots/remakes/rehashes of IP's from 10-50 years ago. Like Indiana Jones 5 with an 80-year old  Harrison Ford or the umpteenth reboot of The Exorcist  with a 90-year old Ellen Burstyn and a reboot of Twister of all things. 

But looking at next year, yeah there's going to be some movies that looked like it was approved for shareholders like reboots to Final Destination and I Know What You Did Last Summer, A reboot of the Jurassic Park reboot (Universal still hasn't learned i guess), and Hollywood taking a dump on Chris Sanders' legacy by making live action versions of his movies to make a quick buck for nostalgic manchildren. 

But there is some interesting mix or IP's and original stuff . And some of the original stuff are from directors like  Ryan Coogler, Koganada, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, James L Brooks, Joseph Kosinski, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Sure  the schedule could change and  are they going to be homeruns? Who knows but even then it starting to regain my confidence towards mainstream movies again and maybe it's going to start a new resurgence in getting more quirkier or high concept movies made again from the majors.",gearwest11,1hdjul2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hdjul2/2025_might_be_one_of_the_most_interesting_years/,2024-12-13 19:15:10,0,0.29,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hdjul2

It then goes to two boys who are hanging outside their place with three Latino kids. One is a young girl who doesn't talk. The Latino kids parents arrive home and those three kids leave. Then the robber guy almost runs into the two young boys and yells at them, and their mom says hey watch it.

Robber guy goes in his apartment/house and looks for a place to hide his money. He looks in the freezer and various other spots before eyeballing a little attic thing in the ceiling. That's all I saw. It's buuuugging me. Robber dude looked a little like Steve Buschemi.

movies,Movie budgets make me sick,"With the Brutalist nearing release (at least down under), it’s had me thinking about the sickening budgets of movies. The Brutalist was reportedly made for $10m and is, by all accounts, amazing.

Comparatively, the recent shit show of Joker Folie a Deux was made for $250m, 25x the budget of the Brutalist.

Where has the industry gone so wrong that $250m is blown on a horrific flop when we could get multiple smaller movies, that have every chance of being much better??

Edit: Yes, I understand that there’s no correlation between budget and quality, my point is that a hell of a lot more talented filmmakers would be able to take their shot if there were 25 smaller budget movies instead of a single giant budget flop.

movies,What over-30-year-old movie's quality have you come to appreciate greatly over most made in the last 30?,"I watched the original The Wizard of Oz the other day and hadn't seen it in a while, and, now that I'm much older, was just absolutely in awe at the acting, casting, production quality, set designs, script, camera work, the fact that it not only had color in a 1939 film, but the use of it was better than most movies (for example, a horse that changed colors, ruby red shoes, changing from B/W to color, yellow brick road, green witch, etc.), the fact that it was also a musical... and so on.  I was blown away that it *didn't* get best picture that year (it lost to Gone With The Wind, which I have not yet seen, but based on what I have seen of it, seems wild that it beat TWOO).  

It's no wonder it's a classic and can still be watched to this day and loved.  The true effort and creativity (originality) that went into it is almost unfathomable.  This is also considering the resources and technology (or lack thereof) they had at the time to make such a film.  I miss it as films today seem so low-effort, and are all effects and shock value (which isn't inherently a bad thing, but considering some of the best movies I've ever seen had little to none, it says a lot) with little substance and poorly put together.

On the one hand it’s pointed out no one could have possibly known about the bug in the store that captured him loudly and recklessly announcing that he had the ledger, especially given that the bug wasn’t even there in relation to the skim, but on the other hand Artie was told very pointedly do not keep a ledger and he still did because the bosses knew what it’d cause if it was ever discovered.

movies,Why I'm Frustrated with the Coyote Vs. Acme Crowd,"It’s not just about the fact that Coyote Vs. Acme is likely lost forever—that’s frustrating, yes—but what really annoys me is how some people keep reacting to *The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie* as if Warner Bros. is releasing it. They're complaining that *this* movie is coming to theaters while Coyote Vs. Acme isn’t, and it’s honestly infuriating.  

Let me break this down for you:  

1. **Warner Bros. is NOT releasing this movie.** It was sold to an indie distributor. If it hadn’t been bought, it might have suffered the same fate as Coyote Vs. Acme. Thanks to this sale, it’s now getting a theatrical release, but that’s not because of WB.  


2. **This is a traditionally animated Western film in theaters!** Let’s be real—these movies don’t usually do well at the box office. Judging by the marketing's view counts, it’s probably heading toward being a flop unless it gets serious support soon. Releasing the trailer on the same day as the Game Awards? Not the best move. But instead of helping this film succeed, some people are whining about Coyote Vs. Acme. You’re not helping.  


3. **This movie has had a rough journey.** It started as an HBO Max exclusive during the pandemic, set to eventually air on Cartoon Network. Then production was halted during the WB Discovery merger and David Zaslav’s infamous tax write-off spree. Only after being sold did work resume, and now it’s finally getting a theatrical release. It had its premiere during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and was extremely positively received. It is also the first real original Looney Tunes movie on the big screen. It's not a short. It's not a collection of shorts. It's a full-length, fully animated movie with an original story.


So, to all those targeting this film: Stop complaining about how a movie you didn’t even know or care about didn’t get released for a second. Instead, show some support for a movie that actually *did* survive against all odds. This could’ve easily been lost media too.  


If you actually care about what’s happening at Warner Bros. Discovery—or even about movies like Coyote Vs. Acme—then PROVE IT. Support The Day the Earth Blew Up. This is your chance to send a message.

Here's the trailer if you haven't seen it:

movies,Favorite movie by european country: United Kingdom Part 2 - Northern Ireland,"Hello there,

I think an introduction to what I'm doing here is no longer necessary after such a long time, so I'd rather start with the fact that I would like to announce an earlier winner - a winner from a country that is very close to my heart, not least because of the current situation: At least according to your votes, ***Тіні забутих предків*** (engl.: *Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors*) is the favorite movie set in Ukraine. So just before the end, a film from the 60s lands [on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) once again.

When I realise that I won't be drawing your attention to this list so often anymore, I'm getting a little wistful. Even if the watchthrough is still to come, my Reddit journey through the filmed Europe is slowly coming to an end... But what an end it is! To be honest, the UK, a country made up of several countries, is actually giving me a bit of a headache. Yesterday we found the first contender for your favorite movie set in UK, when we took a look at movies set in England. But while in the case of England it is strange that it should be a country and at the same time part of a country, its status as a country is in the end comparatively undisputed... and by that I mean the comparison with **Northern Ireland**, which you can read about on Wikipedia after all:

&gt;**Northern Ireland** (Irish: *Tuaisceart Éireann* \[ˈt̪ˠuəʃcəɾˠt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ\] Ulster Scots: *Norlin Airlann*) is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland that is variously described as a country, province or region.

As an outsider, I just want to shout out: ‘Jeez, finally decide on something!' But to keep the peace and because I'm going to declare a UK winner at the end anyway, I'll leave it that way. But I'll also keep to the usual rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,The Wackness (2008) nails the 90s New York atmosphere. ,"If you don't know, the Wackness is a movie about a fresh out of high school teen who sells weed in 90s New York. While there he sells weed to a pyschiatrist names Dr Squires who has step daughter that he falls in live with. Honestly, the movies needs more recognition. I recommend watching it first since it's worth the hour and 40 minutes.
 

First of all the movie looks absolutely beautiful. It really nails the atmosphere of 90s New York. Some examples are the Twin Towers, the Music Scene and the cinematography.  The cinematography is great and has many beautiful scenes. 

Most of the characters are written quite well especially Dr Squires. The movie pretty much shows 2 stories, Luke Shapiro and Dr Squires. They both are pretty depressed and have trouble with romance. And I think Luke Shpairo and Dr Squires relationship is kinda like a father to son, they are completely differnet ages but suffer with the same problems. I think in my view you could see Dr Squires trying to help Luke so he doesn't become him. I think the movie shows that if Luke is in the same direction he is in he will end up like Squires. Honesty Luke and Squires have the best chemistry and scenes together. And the way they written Squires wife relationship and Luke and Stephanie relationship is great.
 
It also has a great soundtrack. If you love 90s hiphop the film and actually fits in with the movie well. 

And the movie has great commentery. The movie portrays 90s New York problems well with Rudy Giuliani drug war aganist weed as a supporting part of the story. 


The only problem i have is Josh Pecks acting. I think this is one of those rare times where a character is written well but the actor isn't great. Josh Peck does more better in comedic roles and his acting isn't good in this film. I don't know how you describe it but Josh Peck has trouble portraying a pot head in this story. 


Anyway I love this film, The cinematography is great, the music is great, the writing is good, and despite Josh Pecks performance, I think everyone else did a good job.

In the beginning of the movie in the chimpanzee testing lab, were the videos of rioting just normal riots/violence from your typical world issues?

movies,28 Weeks Later: 2 hours 27 minute walk to chopper pick up point,"I'm re-watching 28 Weeks later and after the outbreak, Sgt Doyle is trying to save the kids and a handful of red shirts. Chopper pilot Flynn tells Sgt Doyle that the napalm attack will drop in four minutes. He then tells him to make his way to Regent's Park as he can land there.  
Regents Park is a two and a half hour walk from Canary Wharf. And London has so much parkland that the city is technically classed as a forest so I'm sure he could have found a closer spot to play Choplifter.  
Lol, live update while I watch.  
After the pickup in Regent's Park is a no go due to them being swarmed by infected, Flynn then tells Doyle he needs to get to Wembley Stadium . . . which is another 2 hour 50 minute walk :)

movies,Sing Sing review ,"Sing Sing: 

Now that’s how you make a movie. A completely grounded script that makes you feel emotions on such a deep level that didn’t know was possible from a movie. You can feel the tension in scenes like watching a caged tiger pace up and down staring at you. 

Colman Domingo puts in the performance of a century. The subtleness of his actions, to his breaking point in the movie. He goes to lengths that are completely elegant and alluring. His character work here is truly groundbreaking, like I said when his character reaches that breaking point you feel it all, everything his character is feeling you feel so powerfully. Clarence Maclin does supporting acting and then some. He makes you feel uneasy with the way he walks and his facial expressions but you always feel there’s something underneath the hard exterior. A perfect portrayal of character that’s desperate to protect himself from where he is. I forgot I was watching actors on a screen, everyone totally disappears in to their roles. 

The camera work here is something to behold. The hand held shots are exquisitely displayed. The cinematography like an artists gallery on display. The editing as well is of the highest quality. The score like a melodic symphony that graces your ears. The true essence of the dialogue will leave you hooked on every sentence, every word. 

From its captivating opening to its heart lifting end this movie will you make your heart and soul rise from your body. Everything is orchestrated to perfection. Well and truly revolutionary on all levels.

movies,If you had to say... who is the greatest actor of all time and why?,"I have watched thousands upon thousands of movies in my years. All genres of all decades. I've thought about this a lot, and I'll give my answer from a position of being a self-proclaimed ""movie connoisseur"".

There's hundreds of amazing actors that have done incredible works, but when it comes to picking a ""best"" I had to do a lot of sifting and made some very difficult choices of dropping the top players.

I won't give this accolade to anyone purely based on their merits or personal successes in the film industry. I don't how care how big their award closet is or how many top-grossing films they starred in. Although awards correlate with great acting, they are in no way indicative of who the greatest actor is in my humble opinion. 

There's good actors, great actors, and incredible ones. Then there's actors that seem to transcend acting in a movie and literally become the characters (and I'm not just talking about method acting). I'm talking about actors that have you convinced you're not watching a script come to life, but instead your watching someone's life.

I believe it is a toss up between these 2. My first pick is Daniel Day Lewis. When I watched him in The Phantom Thread, I was convinced he must be playing himself because there's no way thats an actor pretending to be someone else. Then I saw him in Gangs Of New York and ofcourse my favorite movie, There Will Be Blood. Completely different characters and each felt like they  were played by different actors. Given his reputation I'm sure it's no surprise to many that hes a contender to be one of if not the best actor ever and he deserves that recognition.

The second I'm sure will be very controversial to many, especially given the hundreds of names of big actors. I'm sorry, but it has to be Robin Williams. Yes, I said Robin Williams.

If you've ever seen one of his movies (or if you haven't seen one in a long time), I can assure you that you'll see what I mean and where I'm coming from. Every movie Robin is in feels like someone just bought a camera and filmed his life for a while.

Nothing felt acted, every word feels lived. Every action is heart-felt.
Look into his eyes as he speaks. It's almost impossible to believe that he wasn't that character, and wasn't living in that scenario.

movies,Watching Dead Man (1995) and Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) back-to-back is a unique experience,"*Dead Man* is an acid western in which a wounded accountant named William Blake teams up with a strange Native American man named Nobody, who happens to be a fan of the artist William Blake and believes the accountant is a vengeful reincarnation of the more famous Blake. The movie plays with western tropes, but it is mostly a somber meditation on death.

*Ghost Dog* is more modern and less bizarre, but it explores many of the same themes and features a similarly heightened reality in which a masterful modern assassin takes strong influence from the Hagakure as he works for (and then against) a bunch of old wiseguys.

They're both unconventional independent action-thrillers by Jim Jarmusch. Both feature a protagonist who acts as a personification of death, often effortlessly killing various stereotypes (cowboys, gangsters). Both films are very philosophical and artistic, but in different ways.

In addition to death and philosophy, the two films are also quite amusing. Jarmusch's dry sense of humor contrasts well with the dark plots full of murder. I like that there's nothing flashy about either movie's world. Dead Man makes the old west feel like a dirty and miserable playground for deranged weirdos, and in Ghost Dog the modern city run by gangsters looks totally mundane and unglamorous, an environment plagued by elderly has-been punks with guns.

The subdued reality of the world and its villains allows the heightened reality of the heroes to shine. There's nothing really superhuman about Blake or Ghost Dog, but the way they intensely associate themselves with death and the fatalism that breeds puts them on another level than the basic bad guys they do battle with.

But when it comes to today's country, it is sometimes a little difficult to understand, at least for me as an outsider.

I know, I know, Wikipedia can never be the last source, but let's take a look on it here. When it comes to the UK, it clearly says:

&gt;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.

At the same time, you can read on another article:

&gt;Since 1922, the United Kingdom has been made up of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which collectively make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland (avoriously described as a country, province, jurisdiction or region.

Further internet research has shown that not only for me as a non-native speaker, but also for the British themselves, it is sometimes not so clear where their country begins and their state ends. Even here in the discussion group I have even read that the UK is not a country at all, then again that it is a country made up of several countries (sometimes by one and the same person). It's all quite confusing, but I think I've found a solution that I can live with.

Today we're going to start with films set in **England**. Over the next few days, we'll do the same with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. On the fifth day, the respective individual winners will then compete against each other again, so that we have a winner for the UK, but also winners for the individual ‘sub-countries’. I think that's a lot of effort, but hey, even if I think the UK members should sort out once and for all whether they want to be federal states or separate countries, I can't ignore the actual situation. In return, I ask you not to ignore the following two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,"With 2024 almost over, what are your top 3 movies of the year?","Mine:

1. The Substance (very fun and extra points for originality)

2. Alien: Romulus (also very fun)

3. Wicked (defying gravity! Wonka × Maleficent x Harry Potter)

Honorable mentions that also need a shout-out:

- Anora (admittedly I didn't really get this one but it's a humongous emotional roller coaster that I think again about from time to time)

- The First Omen (refreshing to see evil Christians in a horror movie)

- The Wild Robot (heartwarming and a surprise from DreamWorks)

- Robot Dreams (quite relatable, teaches a good lesson)

Not out yet but I'm looking forward to:

- Nosferatu (same director of The Witch which I really enjoyed)

- Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (my childhood favorite Shadow! and voiced by Keanu Reeves!

movies,Highlander - What if Kurgan had won?  Could he really do anything?,"This is a very old movie with well know ending, so need to spoiler tag.   Don't read any further if you somehow haven't seen Highlander after 40 years.

There were lines in the movie where Ramirez (Sean Connery) warned Connor that they couldn't let The Kurgan win the prize, or mankind would enter a terrible darkness and never recover.

But what if Kurgan had beaten Connor, and won the prize?   What could he really have done to the world?  As we saw in Connor's closing comments during the ending, he became mortal.   He did say he ""knew everything"" and could basically understand everyone in the worlds feelings and intentions.

So if their worst fear came true and the Kurgan won - so what?  He is now mortal and can be killed.   How would he topple the worlds governments who were defended by massive Armies, war machines, and technology?  

The Kurgan would be the best swordsman in the world which would be meaningless in the 1980s.   He would have a great understanding of people and be able to manipulate SOME people do his bidding, but it doesn't seem like he could really surpass the level of ""local kingpin""

Any thoughts on what ""prize Kurgan"" could actually do to the world?
