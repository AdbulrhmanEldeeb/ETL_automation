What are your Top 5 favourite movies of this year so far ?

Mine are                       -

1. Dune Part 2  - No doubt the greatest movie of the year and a perfect balance between  spectacle and detailed world building .


2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.



3. Kill     - An Indian movie which surpasses the level of modern Hollywood Action movies with ease imo . Non Stop insane ride of high octane realistic action sequences . ( Chad Stahelski is going to remake this movie in English )



4. The Substance    - The craziest a movie can get .



5. Smile 2      - A fresh engaging horror flick which lives up to the hype.

movies,Saw Moonraker last night first time and in a theater. What a ridiculous fun movie. Anyone else a fan?,"Saw it last night at  midnight screening in a really great palace theater in LA called the Vista owned by Tarantino so it was an original 35mm print. He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. 

A few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  

* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. 
* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. 
* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. 
* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.

Loved it.  Though I suspect people who like a more serious bond are not fans?

movies,Unique Animated Films for Family,"What are some unique and lesser known animated films for family and kids? Stuff similar to Studio Ghibli movies or the examples I've listed below. Looking for good stories, unique presentation, distinct visual style, etc. Characters should not have heavy attitudes or behavioral problems. Lesser known animated films.

Bad Examples: I did not like 'The Boy and The Beast' because it starts out with the kid full of anger expressing how much he hates everything and everyone. Not something I'd want my kid to watch. Poupelle of Chimney Town starts off with a terribly loud and annoying musical scene.

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

Long Way North

April and the Extraordinary World

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

The Magician's Elephant

Eleanor's Secret

Sea Beast


These classic animated films:

Treasure Planet

Atlantis

Road to El Dorado

Titan A.E.

The Iron Giant

Prince of Egypt

Films like Encanto, Moana, Rayaa, etc. are all very good but are not exactly underrated films.
