webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:** For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it’s missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:** I’m not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review—I wouldn't fully trust it—making things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:** The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don’t offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:** Easy code export, since everything’s already local.

**V0:** V0 feels like me—it gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It’s not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:** Claude’s UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn’t straightforward.

Overall, Claude’s consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It’s stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,2,0.57,2,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

They act as notification channels (like emails)—which is helpful for many teams—but they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers’ comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.
* **Escalate notification**: The bot can be configured to notify a manager if a PR sits for too long without reviews.

webdev,iOS Safari theme-color behaviour,"Recently, I was building a form for my agency’s website and decided to add a top bar and link to it. Once everything was done, I noticed on my iPhone that the theme color automatically matched the red of the top bar. I immediately thought, “Alright, let’s add some meta tags to specify the theme color.” I included tags for both dark and light color schemes, as well as a default one without any media query. Then, I added some JavaScript to ensure the theme color would dynamically switch between dark and light modes.

However, I noticed that if the theme color was set to pure white (#FFFFFF), Safari would still auto-adjust it to match the top bar’s color. I tried everything—media queries, adjusting the HTML structure, and other methods—but nothing worked. Safari just overrides white and picks the top bar’s color automatically. I inspected my website and confirmed the theme color was set to #FFFFFF, but Safari ignored it.

In the end, I changed the light mode color to #FEFEFE, which Safari respects, unlike pure white. It’s such a strange and unnecessary limitation. I had to make this adjustment because I didn’t want the site to look like you’re in a call when browsing the agency website.

So, I’m curious—how do you handle this issue? Do you even care about these kinds of details, or would you just leave it as it is?

webdev,Advice needed: Looking for a Freelancer to Build an AI-Powered LL.M.-Matching Website – What Should I Look For?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently planning a website that helps users find the perfect matching offer on my site. The idea is to provide general information on the landing page, and then users can input their preferences via an AI chatbot (the best example i can find is Fiverr Neo). Based on their answers, the bot will suggest matching offers from a database. The rest of the site will offer detailed information about the individual offers.

I've already set up a WordPress site on google cloud and have a rough idea of how this could work technically. Now, I’m looking to hire a freelancer to bring this project to life. Before I proceed, I need some advice as i have never worked with freelancer before.

What should I look for in a freelancer?

What skills should they have? (e.g., WordPress, Dialogflow/OpenAI API, database integration, UX/UI design)

Are there specific certifications or portfolios I should check?

Should I hire someone specialized in AI, or will a skilled web developer suffice?



Budget and Timeline:

What’s a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I’m open to better alternatives if suggested.

Bonsai-CLI will streamline web development for agencies or solo developers. I think it will truly 10-100x my development speed, for websites or web apps.

Bonsai-CLI allows you to generate a beautiful web app in seconds, using pre-built and designed Tailwind/Alpine components. All the copy, images, layouts, components, templates, styles can be configured by AI in a matter of seconds.

It’s built specifically for Roots WP stack at the moment, in the future it could support more stacks.

Once you have a [Roots.io](http://Roots.io) site up running, you can run two commands to create a new landing page–

`wp acorn bonsai:init`

`wp acorn bonsai:generate bonsai`

At the moment, the landing page is fairly basic. I’m going to add all of my custom built components to it. Once Bonsai-CLI is done, it’s going to be able to build full on web apps in a matter of seconds. That’s the goal.

webdev,How I solved common Prisma ORM errors,"I have been using Prisma ORM for the last 2 years, and I have experience with troubleshooting different types of error.

In this post, I want to share it with you, so you don’t have to spend hours figuring out what I’ve already learned.

**Why Prisma?**

I have been using Prisma to interact with the database for all my SaaS products. So far, I’ve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let’s start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that’s not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don’t have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I’ve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn’t have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn’t want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    └───src
        │   index.js
        │   index.js.map
        │
        └───functions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    │   tsconfig.base.json
    │   
    └───packages
        └───bTSOrdAddrsCreate
            │   _registerPaths.js
            │   _registerPaths.js.map        
            │   
            └───src
                └───functions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

I’ve been working on an app called [Pain Coach](https://paincoach.online) for the past few months, with the help of a friend who is a Physiotherapist. 

We began developing it as a tool that they would be able to use in their own practice, a way to give them more insight into what is causing their patients to have flare ups, and to give patients a way to understand what might be negatively impacting their pain.

However we wanted to see if people would be interested in something like this as a publicly available app instead of doing business to business, so we put together a small demonstration and waiting list page.
