There used to be a lot of great online game servers with different game types, and some with mods, and I used to play those quite a bit.

I'm getting a new laptop so she is going to use my old one and try to find some new games she can play without getting sick.

What are some games that are good for people who get motion sickness? She likes RPGs, magic and fantasy, adventure games. Not much for shooters, racing, or sports games. She plays a bit of WoW, but I'd like to find some things that aren't subscription based since she refuses to pay for that. I have Game Pass, so that would be ideal, but going through Steam or GoG is fine too. Nothing super graphic intensive since she'll be playing on a 4 year old Alienware laptop with a RTX 2060.

gaming,"Best ""I don't need a life"" Game during Steam's Autumn Sale?","I'm trying to stay under $20, but can go up to $30 if I skip a few meals this week.

(thanks in advance!!!)

EDIT: Thank you for your concern (those of you who said something).  I will not be skipping meals due to my gaming addiction.  I'm a little high on cannabis and thought my ""post desperation"" would help to show how much a retired old man appreciates every dollar (and some of the cheaper games have the best stories or are crazy challenging/interesting).

EDIT 2:  To everyone who contributed, thank you!  So far I pulled the trigger on....

Kingdom Come : Deliverance (with all DLC) for $3.99

&amp;

Cities for $2.99
