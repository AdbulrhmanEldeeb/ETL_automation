Physics,I graduated 8 years ago with a B.Sc and M.Sc in Physics and Chemistry Honours. ,"Graduated 8 years ago with a B.Sc and M.Sc in Physics and Chemistry Honours. I still reminisce about the late nights in labs, study groups, and the joy of learning with friends. I wanted to do a PhD but couldn’t stand the 7-year slog of academic bureaucracy. Recently, I’ve been diving back into my undergrad notes to relearn and keep my mind sharp.

Physics,Who was R Rinkel?,"I'm currently writing a report on the Ruchardt and Rinkel experiments I did in my uni labs, and while trying to look into the background of both, I found nothing about Rinkel, not even a first name beyond ""R"".

Physics,I want to keep up with Physics,"Hi everyone, this is a sincere question about myself. I graduated with a degree in EE(Electrical Engineering), and I have worked for 3 years now. I never pursued a Physics major, but that is one of my favorites. I always have some basic physics books around me for all these years. Recently, I just feel like I can no longer understand some of the latest trends or news in the Physics field. Is there any way that I can keep up even as an amateur? For example, I considered attending a half-time school on the weekend. Or are there any good online courses that I can take?",Orian-,1h3ndo6,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h3ndo6/i_want_to_keep_up_with_physics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h3ndo6/i_want_to_keep_up_with_physics/,2024-11-30 21:52:49,11,0.71,11,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3ndo6

Physics,"What is the Main Motivation for Weak Scale Supersymmetry (SUSY) After the Negative Results from the LHC, XENONnT, Searches for Proton Decay, EDM, etc.?","SUSY is an attractive (and natural) property to have for our world especially if we want to build a theory of quantum gravity (vis-a-vis, superstring theory, supergravity etc.). And I understand the basic motivation behind it too, why would nature, after all, not utilize spin 3/2 when she already utilizes the others (0, 1/2, 1, 2). However, for quantum gravity we only need SUSY at the Planck scale NOT at the Weak scale. So massively broken SUSY is not an issue for quantum gravity.

From my understanding the original motivation some 40 years ago for expecting Weak scale (slightly broken) SUSY was as follows:
1. The so-called WIMP miracle, a candidate for dark matter,
2. Exact unification of the coupling constants at GUT scale,
3. Fixing the Heirarchy problem and the Higgs mass,
4. 'Improving' the discrepancy in the cosmological constant problem.

(If I have understood these incorrectly or if you want to add more reasons, feel free to correct me!)

Now, from what I understand the non-detection of SUSY or WIMPs at the LHC and dark matter experiments (with XENONnT, LZ, etc., now hitting the neutrino floor), along with the growing limits on proton decay and EDM for SUSY models, we are reaching the limits of what SUSY was intended to fix in the first place!

So, my question is, am I missing something from this picture? Is there still any good motivation for Weak scale SUSY?",canweaffordstickers,1h40qte,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h40qte/what_is_the_main_motivation_for_weak_scale/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h40qte/what_is_the_main_motivation_for_weak_scale/,2024-12-01 10:47:24,7,0.75,7,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h40qte
