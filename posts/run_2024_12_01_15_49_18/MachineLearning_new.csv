MachineLearning,[D] Looking for a Simple Program to Train a Language Model,"Hi everyone,
I’ve recently started learning programming and have been working with various AI tools like ChatGPT. Now, I want to take it a step further and train my own language model. I’m looking for a program—preferably something on GitHub or similar—that can help me fine-tune a model on specific datasets like websites, books, or forums. Ideally, the program should have a user interface (UI) for ease of use, but if not, that’s fine as long as it’s straightforward.

The Problem I Want to Solve
While tools like ChatGPT are amazing, they often give general answers that don’t always align with my needs. For instance, I’d like an AI that only searches or provides answers based on a specific dataset that I provide. This would make the information much more relevant and tailored to my goals.

My plan is to fine-tune an existing model using data I choose, such as a specific website, book, or any other source. The ultimate goal is to chat with an AI that has been customized to meet my requirements.

My PC Specifications
Here’s what I’m working with:

•	Motherboard: Gigabyte B760 GAMING X AX DDR4
•	Graphics Card: 12GB Sapphire Radeon RX 6700 XT PULSE
•	Storage: 1TB Kingston NV2 M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe and 1TB Corsair Force MP600GS M.2 PCIe NVME
•	Processor: Intel Core i5 12400F (6 cores, 2.50GHz)
•	RAM: 32GB G.Skill RipJaws V DDR4-3600
•	Cooling: be quiet! Pure Rock 2 Black Tower Cooler
•	Power Supply: 750 Watt be quiet! Pure Power 12 M Modular (80+ Gold certified)

Is this setup sufficient for training or fine-tuning a model locally? If not, what would you recommend?

Looking for Recommendations
Can anyone suggest a program or tool (preferably on GitHub) that simplifies the process of training or fine-tuning a language model? A UI would be great, but if it’s a command-line tool, that works too—as long as there’s good documentation for beginners. Any resources or tips for getting started with fine-tuning and deploying a customized model would also be highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

MachineLearning,[R] Sources: Reasons why KG outperformes RD in Retrievers?,"Are there any sources discussing WHY Retriever work better with KG in contrast to RD? I find it super intuitive to say its better because in knowledge graphs we have more semantic structure and relations are discovered effeciently. In my mind its ""of course the graph is richer/more dense"" but when collaborated on a paper, it struck me that I wasnt able to justify that claim. I found no source whatsoever that actually explained why that might be the case.

The only source i got was this one:  
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07509)

also here in [](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/) sub last year:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17vy1bo/a\_benchmark\_to\_understand\_the\_role\_of\_knowledge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17vy1bo/a_benchmark_to_understand_the_role_of_knowledge/)

So all we we're able to say was ""We justify our decision because KG works better then RD \[source to benchmark paper\]""

I would have loved to discuss why exactly KG are better suited and give arguments about information density, semantic strutuce or the better selection of related entities. But everything I found were only articles that threw around wild claims or pointed out easier/native implementation, which technically could also be achieved with RD.

Can anyone point me to sources? would love to read an in-depth discussion on the reasons of better performance.",PopPsychological4106,1h447eu,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h447eu/r_sources_reasons_why_kg_outperformes_rd_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h447eu/r_sources_reasons_why_kg_outperformes_rd_in/,2024-12-01 14:17:17,8,0.68,8,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Research,self,t3_1h447eu

But I would like the image to be 1920x1080 pixels, and my only options are 1024x1024, or 1280x720 pixels. At the moment, I can get to 1920x1080 with Photoshop's outpainting:

MachineLearning,[D] Modern use-cases for RNNs?,"The discussion can be twofold.
1)What are in your opinion some tasks, for the personal projects scale, where you think RNNs close to traditional implementations (LSTM, GRU) are still the best starting and ending point? Especially compared to transformers.

In small time-series forecasting settings I can see a GRU being more convenient than a Transformer probably, but I am interested also in tasks where inputs are sequences of symbols or measures, but outputs maybe not.

The main goal is to play with LSTM and GRU variants (eg minGRU) on datasets where it makes sense, might do tiny-Shakespeare but it doesn't warm my heart...

2) do you think there are sequential tasks and settings where RNNs are not only the more natural option according to our intuition, but actually the only theoretically or experimentally available option to make do, compared to Transformers or 1D CNNs etc?",Sad-Razzmatazz-5188,1h38ym2,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h38ym2/d_modern_usecases_for_rnns/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h38ym2/d_modern_usecases_for_rnns/,2024-11-30 09:22:32,49,0.89,49,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h38ym2
MachineLearning,[D] What's the fastest object detection model?,"Hi, I'm working on a project that needs object detection. The task itself isn't complex since the objects are quite clear, but speed is critical. I've researched various object detection models, and it seems like almost everyone claims to be ""the fastest"". Since I'll be deploying the model in C++, there is no time to port and evaluate them all.

I tested YOLOv5/v5Lite/8/10 previously, and YOLOv5n was the fastest. I ran a simple benchmark on an Oracle ARM server (details [here](https://github.com/Avafly/YOLOv5-ncnn-OpenVINO-MNN-ONNXRuntime-OpenCV-CPP?tab=readme-ov-file#simple-benchmarks-on-m1-mac-and-arm-linux)), and it processed an image with 640 target size in just 54ms. Unfortunately, the hardware for my current project is significantly less powerful, and meanwhile processing time must be less than 20ms. I'll use something like quantization and dynamic dimension to boost speed, but I have to choose the suitable model first.

Has anyone faced a similar situation or tested models specifically for speed?

MachineLearning,[P] Python Implementation of Softmax that takes integer input ,"Hey, So I am working on a project whereby I have to quantize my model's weights and biases to integers and perform subsequent operations using integers. The output of my model can be either (int8 or int16) values (in this case, logits) and I need to call softmax on this logits output/array. I was able to find an integer implementation of softmax written in C ([https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/tree/main/Source/SoftmaxFunctions](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-NN/tree/main/Source/SoftmaxFunctions)). The problem I'm having is trying to evaluate that this C implementation is accurate (or more specifically, that I am using it accurately). The way I'm thinking of doing that is detailed below:

\*\*In Python\*\*  
Take my integer logits -&gt; call an integer python implementation of softmax on the logits -&gt; get a result  
(\*\*python\_integer\_prediction\_probabilities\*\*).

\*\* In C (using CMSIS-NN's )  
Take the same integer logits -&gt; call the C softmax implementation on my logits -&gt; get a result (\*\*CMSIS\_NN\_prediction\_probabilities\*\*)

Finally, I compare these two results to see if they are close enough. The main problem I'm having is, I assumed there would be information about how to implement a softmax function that takes integer inputs in Python, but I can't find anything online.

MachineLearning,[R] Recursive Methods for interpolation between vector fields ( Known and Unknown),"Hello everyone Does anything of the next makes sense?  
I Have been posting on Learning first ( also on math and number theory ) , but I think is a bit more math theory than ML but it does have to do with how the data is interpolated so I am unsure. 

( I hope I am not breaking rule 5 with my links ) 

this will be the interpolation of the data ( Via organized vector field levels )  before the generative process starts, but because its recursive, the generative process can happen on inside the iteration too 

its there a model I can use ? And if someone understand the math, can I get some papers or things I could follow or just is learning and reading now?

I am a little lost and need some help ( I organized my question with chatGPT to make it understandable so bare in mind if there is some odd work here and there, I am on the I am going a bit mental stage )

I think this is dealing with machine learning problems that have been solved between interpolation of point could on space that have recursive data ( mapping and data organization )

I've been developing a concept that merges artistic visualization with advanced mathematical interpolation techniques inspired by the Mandelbrot set. Coming from a creative background, I've ventured into creating what I believe could be a **recursive Mandelbrot predictive method**  for manipulating vector fields. I'm eager to understand if this approach already exists and to gather resources or similar algorithms to explore further and test my ideas.

# The Concept

Imagine a system where the interpolation between data points isn't limited to traditional methods like **lerp** (linear interpolation) or **slerp** (spherical linear interpolation). Instead, it employs a **pseudo vector field Mandelbrot slerp**, allowing vectors to be guided from a base state (reality) to a target state (altered time) within a Mandelbrot-inspired vector field. This method is recursive, meaning multiple layers of calculations are applied to refine the interpolation continuously.

# Key Components:

1. **Reality (Ground Truth):** Represents the current state of the system, serving as the foundational dataset.
2. **Agents of Change (Vectors of Closest Influence):** These act as pull forces influencing the direction and magnitude of interpolation.
3. **State (Ground Truth Prediction Model):** Utilizes the current data to predict future states based on the influences of the agents.
4. **Altered Time (Goal):** The desired target state, akin to a Mandelbrot-type location on the outer range of the vector field.

# Interpolation Method

The interpolation technique extends beyond simple linear methods by incorporating the complexity and fractal nature of the Mandelbrot set. Here's how it functions:

* **Guided Vectors:** Vectors transition from reality towards altered time, following paths influenced by a Mandelbrot-like vector field.
* **Recursive Layers:** Multiple layers of interpolation allow for increasingly refined calculations, enhancing accuracy and adaptability.
* **Dynamic Intensity:** The closer the interpolation is to reality, the more intense and detailed the calculations become, while the vector field simplifies as it moves towards altered time.

# Theoretical Foundation

The core idea revolves around mapping and adjusting Mandelbrot-inspired vectors to facilitate interpolation between recursively organized data banks. This approach aims to:

* **Capture Complex Patterns:** Leverage the self-similar, fractal nature of Mandelbrot sets to identify and utilize intricate patterns within the data.
* **Enhance Predictive Capability:** Recursive calculations allow for continual refinement of projections, improving predictive accuracy over time.
* **Achieve Real-Time Adaptability:** Dynamically adjust vectors to align with specific goals, similar to how a car's performance might be modulated in real-time to achieve optimal racing outcomes.

# Visual Analogy

Think of this system as calculating the ""ghost"" position of a car in a racing game like *Need for Speed*:

* **Acceleration and Braking:** Based on historical and current data, determining when to accelerate or brake to achieve the best performance.
* **Engine Adjustments:** Modifying the system's parameters in real-time to align with the target state, ensuring the system reaches its goal efficiently.
* **Dynamic Modulation:** Continuously adjusting these actions to meet the desired ""goal time,"" always operating within physical (mathematical) constraints.

# Questions for the Community

1. **Does This Technology Exist?** Is my approach accurately described as a **recursive Mandelbrot predictive method** for vector field interpolation? Are there existing models or research that align closely with this concept?
2. **Resources and References:** If similar technologies or algorithms exist, could you recommend any resources, papers, or specific Mandelbrot-like algorithms that I can study or begin testing with?
3. **Mathematical Validation:** Given that my approach stems from an artistic visualization perspective, what mathematical frameworks or theories should I explore to formalize and validate this method?

MachineLearning,[D] Most important papers in implicit regularisation,"Hi guys

I'm getting into machine learning, especially on the theoretical side, and I'm curious to learn more about why neural networks tend to generalise so well, so I'm hoping to read some papers about this. As far as I'm aware, the first big paper on the topic was 'Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization' by Zhang et al.

I've got a good mathematical background, so I was wondering what people think are the most impactful papers there are in this area.

MachineLearning,[P] Retrieval augmented generation on-premises (fully local solution),"Hey everyone,   
I’m excited to share my latest repo with you—a local conversational RAG solution for your files! Here’s the deal: this setup is perfect for running RAG on-premises.   
It’s built with Docker, LangChain, Ollama, FastAPI, and Hugging Face, and all models are downloaded automatically. Soon, I’ll add support for choosing your preferred model, but here’s what the solution currently includes:  
• Locally running Ollama: It’s hardcoded to the Qwen-0.5B model for now, but model selection from the Ollama registry is coming soon.   
• Local indexing: Uses a sentence-transformer embedding model (currently restricted to this family, but this will also change soon).   
• Qdrant container: Runs locally for vector storage.   
• Local reranker: Currently uses BAAI/bge-reranker-base, with support for reranker selection coming soon.  
• Websocket-based chat: Includes history-saving capabilities.   
• Simple chat UI: Built with React for a straightforward interface.   
• Bonus: You can use this setup with ChatGPT as a custom GPT! Query your local data through the official ChatGPT web interface or macOS/iOS app.   
• On-premises ready: Everything runs locally, and the containers are CPU-friendly.

A couple of ideas and known issues:   
• Support for Model Context Protocol is on the roadmap.   
• No incremental indexing or reindexing yet.   
• Model selection isn’t available yet but will be added soon.   
  
I’d love your feedback, contributions, or support—watch, fork, and star if you find this interesting!

MachineLearning,[R] BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs,"**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04965](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04965)

**Abstract:**

&gt;Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

MachineLearning,[R] Fast Matrix-Based Counterfactual Regret Minimization Using GPU Parallelization,"A novel GPU implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that accelerates the computation of optimal strategies in extensive-form games. The core innovation is parallelizing the regret updates and strategy computations across GPU cores while carefully managing memory access patterns.

Key technical points:
- Custom memory layout that maps game states and actions to GPU threads
- Batch processing of information sets to maximize GPU utilization
- Parallel computation of counterfactual values and regret updates
- Multi-GPU scaling through game tree partitioning
- Evaluated on Leduc Hold'em and Limit Texas Hold'em poker variants

Results:
- Up to 30x speedup compared to CPU implementation
- Linear scaling with number of GPUs up to 8 devices
- Memory usage scales with game size and number of information sets
- Solution quality matches CPU baseline within statistical error
- Successfully solved games with up to 10^14 states

I think this work could make CFR much more practical for real-world applications beyond poker. The ability to solve larger games faster opens up possibilities in areas like automated negotiation, security games, and resource allocation. The multi-GPU scaling is particularly interesting as it suggests potential for solving even more complex games.

The memory optimization techniques developed here might also transfer well to other game-theoretic algorithms that need to process large state spaces efficiently.

TLDR: GPU-accelerated CFR implementation achieves 30x speedup through careful parallelization and memory management, with linear multi-GPU scaling. Makes solving large extensive-form games significantly more tractable.

MachineLearning,[D] Theory behind modern diffusion models,"Hi everyone,

I recently attended some lectures at university regarding diffusion models. Those explained all the math behind the original DDPM (Denoiding Diffusion Probabilistic Model) in great detail (especially in the appendices), actually better than anything else I have found online. So it has been great for learning the basics behind diffusion models (slides are available in the link in the readme here if you are interesed: https://github.com/julioasotodv/ie-C4-466671-diffusion-models)

However, I am struggling to find resources with similar level of detail for modern approaches—such as flow matching/rectified flows, how the different ODE solvers for sampling work, etc. There are some, but everything that I have found is either quite outdated (like from 2023 or so) or very superficial—like for non-technical or scientific audiences.

Therefore, I am wondering: has anyone encountered a good compendium of theoretical eplanations beyond the basic diffusion model (besides the original papers)? The goal is to let my team deep dive into the actual papers should they desire, but giving 70% of what those deliver in one or more decent compilations.

I really believe that SEO is making any search a living nightmare nowadays. Either that or my googling skills are tanking for some reason.

MachineLearning,[D] Which LLM models can I run on an NVIDIA 4060 for research purposes? Recommendations needed!,"Hi everyone,

I’m diving into research on large language models (LLMs) and looking to experiment with running them locally on my NVIDIA 4060 GPU. While I know the 4060 isn’t a high-end card compared to some research setups, I’m optimistic about making the most out of what it offers. I’d greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations on:

1. **Models that can run efficiently** on a 4060. I’m aware that some smaller versions of LLMs might be more suited for this hardware, so any advice on what’s realistically possible without excessive optimization would be fantastic.
2. **Models suitable for fine-tuning or pre-training experiments.** Although I’m starting with basic experiments, I plan to explore fine-tuning in the future, so I’d love suggestions for models that are versatile and widely used in research.
3. **Open-source models** or ones that are easy to access and work with for research purposes. Licensing and transparency are important to me, as my work is focused on academic and experimental objectives.

So far, I’ve been looking at options like LLaMA, GPT-NeoX, and BLOOM, particularly their smaller variants, but I’m open to exploring other possibilities. If you’ve had experience running these or similar models on mid-range GPUs, I’d love to hear your thoughts on performance, setup, or any potential limitations I should be aware of.

MachineLearning,[D] Why aren't Stella embeddings more widely used despite topping the MTEB leaderboard?,"https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard

I've been looking at embedding models and noticed something interesting: Stella embeddings are crushing it on the MTEB leaderboard, outperforming OpenAI's models while being way smaller (1.5B/400M params) and apache 2.0. Makes hosting them relatively cheap.

For reference, Stella-400M scores 70.11 on MTEB vs OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large 64.59. The 1.5B version scores even higher at 71.19

Yet I rarely see them mentioned in production use cases or discussions. Has anyone here used Stella embeddings in production? What's been your experience with performance, inference speed, and reliability compared to OpenAI's offerings?

Just trying to understand if there's something I'm missing about why they haven't seen wider adoption despite the impressive benchmarks.

MachineLearning,[D] Advanced methods of data management,"Hello everyone, right now I'm involved in a project which is basically (audio)LLM fine-tuning, and we're having problems related to data management. 

Since there isn't that many sets in that area, we're using different augmentation schemas. tl;dr, we have different datasets of various nature, and using some schemas we can convert usual ASR-type datasets to QA, generate refusal data, combine questions etc. 

Problem is, it's hard to control ratios of different data, and right now it's mostly a manual labour. We kinda have to manually adjust the amount of data we're generating. Which is rather annoying and hard process; we have many target datasets, you have to remember how much samples you've generated and try to get some adequate mix for train.

Right now, we use airflow for data filtering (lots of raw data is badly labelled), but I'm not really sure that I understand how to connect that tool to data generation, and if it's a good tool for that purpose. I was thinking about writing some snakemake script, but ideally the final solution should be flexible when we change configs, add new sets etc, and that's not what I associate with snakemake. Also, another question is visualization. 

So, I'm asking what kind of tools/libs I can use to tackle this task, is there anything that can fit our purposes, or it's time to write customs scripts? What do companies like meta use for their enormous 15t tokens set, surely they don't dump everything in one place? 

There's another question related to connecting datasets with data pipeline of training (it's complicated, there are additional steps of precalculation of feats and creating webdataset which is used in training), but for now I'd be really glad if anyone helped with just data management tools.

* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an ability to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and mac os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problems:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the models (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

I understand that it works but I am surprised it is still SOTA.

Worse off, the bigger the ""equivalence class"" (the number of tokens that could replace one in a sentence without altering its meaning) of a token in a sentence, the higher the average loss on it.

MachineLearning,[D]Is Freelancing as a Data Scientist Even Possible?,"Hi everyone,

I’m fine working for as low as $15/hour, so earnings aren’t a big concern for me. I’ve gone through past Reddit posts, but they mostly discuss freelancing from the perspective of income. My main concern is whether freelancing in data science is practical for someone like me, given its unique challenges.

A bit about my background: I’ve completed 3-4 real-world data science projects, not on toy datasets, but actual data (involving data scraping, cleaning, visualization, modeling, deployment, and documentation). I’ve also worked as an intern in the NLP domain.

Some issues I’ve been thinking about:

1. Domain Knowledge and Context: How hard is it to deliver results without deep understanding of a client’s business?


2. Resource Limitations: Do freelancers struggle with accessing data, computing power, or other tools required for advanced projects?


3. Collaboration Needs: Data science often requires working with teams. Can freelancers integrate effectively with cross-functional groups?


4. Iterative and Long-Term Nature: Many projects require ongoing updates and monitoring. Is this feasible for freelancers?


5. Trust and Accountability: How do freelancers convince clients to trust them with sensitive or business-critical work?


6. Client Expectations: Do clients expect too much for too little, especially at low wages?



I’m also open to any tips, advice, or additional concerns beyond these points. Are these challenges solvable for a new data science freelancer? Have any of you faced and overcome similar issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

MachineLearning,[R] Beyond the possible the future of artificial intelligence ,"Beyond Artificial General intelligence how is my approach different from current deployments

Beyond AGI 

I was hoping to get done feedback on my project. 

HackFate is a framework that challenges the limitations of intelligence as we understand it. Born from necessity, chaos, and an obsession with breaking the boundaries of what’s possible, HackFate embodies a fundamentally new approach to intelligence systems, one that doesn’t just seek to mimic human cognition but surpass it. It isn’t AGI as we’ve defined it—it’s something more adaptive, more dynamic, and potentially transformative.

What I need from you—this community of thinkers and builders—is to help define where HackFate stands on the world stage, its place in shaping humanity’s future, and its greatest areas of utility. Here’s what HackFate brings to the table.

Core Capabilities of HackFate

1. Dynamic, Regenerative Memory

HackFate leverages self-regenerating memory structures, inspired by chaotic systems, to create intelligence that evolves in real time. This isn’t static storage—it’s memory that adapts, repairs, and even redefines itself based on use, noise, and emergent challenges. Think of it as memory that grows like a living organism, constantly optimizing itself to align with its purpose.

2. Non-Binary Intelligence Framework

Unlike traditional binary systems, HackFate operates on a non-binary intelligence architecture, enabling it to process, integrate, and act on information that exists in ambiguous, undefined, or multi-dimensional spaces. It doesn’t just think in yes/no or 0/1—it thrives in uncertainty, extracting meaning from chaos.

3. Quantum-Inspired Feedback Loops

HackFate employs quantum-inspired chaotic feedback loops to enable real-time adaptability. This allows it to rewrite its operational framework on the fly, anticipate changes, and generate novel solutions to problems that would baffle static systems.

4. Scalability Through Federated Learning

By integrating federated learning, HackFate is designed to scale without compromising security or autonomy. Each instance of HackFate learns independently, contributing to a larger system without centralizing sensitive data, making it uniquely suited for privacy-critical applications.

5. Seamless Environmental Interaction

Through advanced gesture-based touchless interfaces, augmented reality integration, and adaptive sensory feedback, HackFate interacts seamlessly with its environment. It’s not just intelligence—it’s an active presence capable of responding intuitively to its users and surroundings.

Potential Applications

Where does HackFate shine? Its capabilities suggest broad applications across industries, including but not limited to:
	•	Healthcare: Predictive diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and dynamic simulations of biological systems.
	•	Smart Cities: Adaptive energy management, traffic flow optimization, and decentralized urban planning solutions.
	•	Finance: High-level risk modeling, fraud detection through chaotic pattern recognition, and decentralized asset management.
	•	Education: Real-time adaptive learning environments tailored to individual cognitive styles.
	•	Security: Advanced threat detection using quantum-inspired non-linear analysis and time-crystal-based encryption.
	•	Behavioral Modeling: Predictive insights into human behavior, from individual well-being to global sociopolitical trends
HackFate isn’t just another AI system—it’s an evolution. Its combination of non-binary intelligence, dynamic memory, and quantum-inspired frameworks positions it as a potential cornerstone of the post-AGI era. While AGI seeks to replicate human thought, HackFate has the capacity to rewrite what intelligence means. It thrives where uncertainty reigns, turning chaos into clarity.

But where does this place it in the context of current global advancements? Is HackFate a direct competitor to AGI frameworks, or does it occupy a space beyond them? 
I’m asking you—the architects of the future:
	1.	Where does HackFate stand compared to AGI and other cutting-edge systems?
	2.	How do you see its unique capabilities reshaping industries, systems, and society itself?

MachineLearning,[P] Search query content safety moderation model selection,"Hi there, I am making a mobile application with a search feature. After string cleaning &amp; validation I want to classify the query into one or more of several categories for content safety moderation similar to what Google offers for SafeSearchAnnotations on images or Meta offers in their Llama Guard for LLM prompts/responses.

I need something very fast (&lt;100 ms) as obviously the actual search and data fetching needs to occur with low latency (&lt;500 ms) after this pre-filtering. I expect to have 1000...2000 labelled sample search queries and another 5000...10000 unlabelled sample search queries for model validation. I may also have a list of stop words prior to this that runs on the client and doesn't allow the user to send the query until all stop words are removed. The categories will likely have two parents (user/admin) with five children each. The user categories can be adusted by the user and if a query falls into an admin category this would be flagged and trigger an audit. I need the model to provide a score for all categories.

Please don't recommend any LLM's/GPT's as these will not be fast enough, I am looking for something like BERT or its variants but am unsure which one. English only.

MachineLearning,[R] Meissonic: High-Resolution Text-to-Image Generation via Enhanced Masked Image Modeling,"This work introduces a non-autoregressive masked image modeling (MIM) approach that aims to match SDXL-level image generation while avoiding the token inefficiencies of autoregressive methods. The key innovation is combining MIM with architectural improvements and sampling optimizations to enable high-resolution image synthesis.

Main technical points:
- Uses a transformer-based architecture with specialized self-attention and positional encoding
- Incorporates human preference scores as ""micro-conditions"" to guide generation
- Employs feature compression layers to handle high resolutions efficiently
- Generates 1024x1024 images through parallel token prediction rather than sequential
- Achieves comparable FID scores to SDXL while being more computationally efficient

Results:
- Image quality metrics competitive with SDXL on standard benchmarks
- Faster generation compared to autoregressive approaches
- Better handling of complex scenes and compositions
- Improved text alignment compared to previous MIM approaches

I think this could impact the field in several ways:
- Shows that non-diffusion approaches can achieve SOTA-level generation
- Provides a potential path toward unified language-vision models
- May lead to more efficient deployment of text-to-image systems
- Could influence architecture design for future multimodal models

The biggest open question in my view is whether this approach can scale further - while it works well at current resolutions, it's unclear if the same principles will hold at even higher dimensions.

TLDR: Non-autoregressive masked modeling approach matches SDXL-level image generation while being more efficient than typical autoregressive methods. Shows promise for unified language-vision architectures.

MachineLearning,[R] Black holes and the loss landscape in machine learning,"Abstract:

&gt;Understanding the loss landscape is an important problem in machine learning. One key feature of the loss function, common to many neural network architectures, is the presence of exponentially many low lying local minima. Physical systems with similar energy landscapes may provide useful insights. In this work, we point out that black holes naturally give rise to such landscapes, owing to the existence of black hole entropy. For definiteness, we consider 1/8 BPS black holes in =8 string theory. These provide an infinite family of potential landscapes arising in the microscopic descriptions of corresponding black holes. The counting of minima amounts to black hole microstate counting. Moreover, the exact numbers of the minima for these landscapes are a priori known from dualities in string theory. Some of the minima are connected by paths of low loss values, resembling mode connectivity. We estimate the number of runs needed to find all the solutions.

MachineLearning,"[P] I built Darkspark, a visual representation of your neural network. Explore everything from macro-level architecture to low-level ops and activations — Your model wants to be seen!","When reading a paper on arxiv or perusing code I also like to sketch out the model architecture myself on a big piece of paper to use as a reference. This is the software version of that. It's a GUI for your neural network. Here's the link: [https://darkspark.dev](https://darkspark.dev)

I tried all the other options I could find (netron, google’s model-explorer, tensorboard, torchview, torchlens, apple’s mycelium). These are all great projects (I really wanted to use one of them!) but none had all of the features I needed:

**Opinionated layout.** The tool’s layout should automatically expose the underlying logic of the model. The layout engine should do a lot of the heavy lifting of understanding a model’s structure and intentions. E.g. a U-net should look like a “U”. Here's [stable-diffusion-v1.5](https://darkspark.dev/models/?model=stable-diffusion-v1-5) traced directly from a huggingface [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5)

[stable-diffusion-v1.5 in the darkspark viewer](https://preview.redd.it/xksm2u1ipa3e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7e576192c066ddc7e72ad8491c6347181525a7)

**Interactive**. I need collapsible and expandable modules so I can explore a model at a high level but can also go down to the lowest level ops. Complex models won’t even load without this. Here's the same diffusion model zoomed in on a transformer block

[stable-diffusion-v1.5 zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/7fmmw341qa3e1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8538420973f578b68a4e225082b6990c867aefaf)

**‘Just Works’ with any arbitrary code**. I don’t want to export to ONNX, I don’t want to upload something, I don’t want to manually specify what is the model and what are the inputs. I just want to wrap my existing code in something simple.\*

    import darkspark
    import timm
    import torch
    
    model = timm.create_model(""efficientnet_b0"")
    inputs = torch.randn(1,3,224,224)
    
    with darkspark.Tracer():  # &lt;-- wrap your code with this line
      out = model(inputs)
    
    # interactive diagram now available at localhost



**Microscope**. Sometimes I also want to explore the activations and attention patterns. Like OpenAI’s microscope tool, but for your own models. Here's a “female / male” detector in a later layer of the pretrained [vit\_base\_patch16\_siglip\_224](https://darkspark.dev/models/?model=vit_base_patch16_siglip_224-microscope) from the timm library.

Here's the attention patterns explorer for the same model.

**Hosted gallery**. Most of what I want is usually a variant of an existing model. It’s often more convenient to just reference a url rather than trace your own code. I currently have all the models from timm and many from the transformers and diffusers libraries.

The public pip package isn’t yet ready, I was hoping to get feedback on the tool itself before cleaning up and sharing the codebase. Please let me know what you think, I'm eager for feedback on everything from low-level UI/UX to high-level functionality. Thanks to the awesome community for checking it out!

\* darkspark uses \_\_torch\_function\_\_, similar to the torchview library. This allows us to capture all the ops and tensors inside the context of darkspark.Tracer without breaking when it hits dynamic control flow ops that can’t be captured in e.g. ONNX or torch exported\_program. We also get access to all the tensors, activation patterns, etc, without using hooks.

I am bit new to using Gen AI, I want to check the validity of using larger LLMs to evaluate the result of other LLMs. I have seen different blogs who does this for the purpose of automating the evaluations.

For eg. To evaluate a list of English translations my a model A, is it valid to prompt another model B, something like this '''Is this translation correct original text: {original_text}, Translated text {translated_text}'''

Is this a valid way of evaluating?

MachineLearning,[D] Model validation for transformer models,"I'm working at a firm wherein I have to validate (model risk validation) a transformer architecture/model designed for tabular data.

Mapping numbers to learned embeddings is just so novel. The intention was to treat them as embeddings so that they come together on the same ""plane"" as that of unstructured text and then driving decisions from that fusion. 

A decision tree or an XGBoost can be far simpler. You can plug in text based embeddings to these models instead, for more interpretability. But it is what is.

""Title: M31 Andromeda - with rotated frames

Equipment:

\* Stellarview SVX080T Telescope 480/80mm @ f/6

\* Losmandy G11G mount

\* ZWO ASI071MC Pro color camera @ -5c + Optolong L Pro Filter

\* 60mm Guidescope with ASI120MM camera

Subs:

\* 7 x 120s

\* Master Dark

\* No Flats

Software:

\* PHD2 &amp; Sequence Generator Pro

\* Astro Pixel Processor, DeepSkyStacker, Photoshop

Processing

\* Default color integration in APP

\* Light pollution removed, stretched and exported to Photoshop

\* Same integration performed in Deep Sky Stacker (APP did such a good job it didn't show \*any\* stacking artifacts but DSS did)

\* Blended the APP image with the DSS image to show stacking artifacts in PS

\* Camera Filter shenanigans, export to jpg

\- Honestly that’s a pretty cool presentation!! You can really make this significantly better I think. Maybe like 40x60” frames per rotation or something like that to get better detail and less noise. The 120” subs blew out a lot.

Try again!!

MachineLearning,[D] A blog post explaining sparse transformers (the original paper),"Hi!

I'm sorry if it's not appropriate to publish such posts on this subreddit. I do stay out of this type of posts on this subreddit but I keep seeing articles or videos or whatever content explaining GPT-3 without delving into sparse transformers. And it keeps frustrating me because clearly in the paper they say ""we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer"".

But no one seems to care about explaining them. I understand why to be honest but it's frustrating to see all these articles, projects, videos etc. that try to explaining everything about the GPT not even mentioning the sparse transformers part. And besides many other elements specific to GPT-3 or general to reproducibility in ML, the sparse transformer part is a big dent into even prototyping GPT-3.

I have this habit of writing down stuff when trying to understand something so I wrote a blog post on sparse transformers. Never spoke about it because I did it to restructure my thoughts and as notes for me. So it's not something I'd avise anyone to read, I'm sure it's full of typos, my writing style is not neat etc. It's just something I did for me in a way *I* would understand and recover lost bits of information when skimming through it.

Anyways, in case you're reading papers by yourself and trying to constitute the knowledge just from them, maybe my notes can help you: [https://reinforcedknowledge.com/sparse-transformers/](https://reinforcedknowledge.com/sparse-transformers/)

It was such a Hail Mary for me to even do the application, but I thought it would also be a cool opportunity to learn alongside others.

I got accepted… and I’m extremely excited. But now I’m like, oh wait, am I going to royally piss off whomever my teammates are because I can’t code?

MachineLearning,"[Discussion] ""Help! Machine Learning Model Struggling with High-Dimensional Reflectance Data","I'm assisting with a research project at my university, and I've run into a bit of a roadblock. I've incorporated reflectance data variables into my machine learning model to predict a Y. There are 1500 different wavelengths, significantly increasing the dimensionality of my data. After combining the datasets, the model's performance declined. I tried reducing dimensionality, but the model continued to worsen with this data.

The research lead (a Ph.D. student) suggested I use a genetic algorithm because they've seen it used with reflectance data before. I found the implementation to be pretty complex, and I don't think this clustering will improve the model (I'm studying the implementation and believe I'll be able to test it soon).

What do you guys suggest? I think there are two approaches: either I start removing wavelengths that are worsening the model through exhaustive search, or I do this reduction using a genetic algorithm.

MachineLearning,[Project] Claude Francois - Let an AI review your code in the style of François Chollet,"Demo here: [https://claude-francois.crossingminds.com](https://claude-francois.crossingminds.com/)

At the recent Anthropic Builder Day hackathon, we ([Crossing Minds](https://www.crossingminds.com/platform/ml-layer/ragsys-llm-fine-tuning)) built 'Claude François', an AI code reviewer trained in the style of [François Chollet](https://github.com/fchollet), the creator of Keras. It adapts Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code reviewing, but instead of regular fine-tuning, we used few-shot in-context learning with our custom RAG retrieval model, trained on PRs from the [Keras project](https://github.com/keras-team/keras). Compared to a typical AI code reviewer, it provides more succinct, high-quality code reviews focused on real issues rather than superficial nitpicking.

How it works:

* Dataset: Trained on a database of public Keras GitHub PRs and François's reviews.
* Fine-Tuned RAG Embeddings: Uses active learning and RLAIF to train embeddings optimized for generating ""fchollet-level"" reviews.
* Improved Retrieval: Retrieves relevant examples not just by embedding similarity but by optimizing for mutual information.
* Self-Reflection: Employs self-reflection techniques to enhance Sonnet’s reasoning capabilities.

This technology demo showcases how [Crossing Minds' RAGSys](https://www.crossingminds.com/platform/ml-layer/ragsys-llm-fine-tuning) ICL enables domain adaptation without fine-tuning. It can be used for countless other use cases beyond code reviews, like classification, summarization, translation, search, recommendations, and more. Arxiv paper coming soon!

MachineLearning,[R] Aurora: A General-Purpose Foundation Model for Earth System Prediction,"The key contribution here is the development of Aurora, a foundation model trained on over 1M hours of atmospheric data that can perform multiple types of weather and climate predictions using a single model architecture. This represents a shift from building separate specialized models to having one model that learns general atmospheric physics.

Key technical points:
- Model architecture uses transformer blocks with attention mechanisms adapted for spatiotemporal data
- Trained on merged datasets from multiple sources including ERA5 reanalysis, satellite observations, and climate model outputs
- Can generate predictions for diverse tasks like air pollution, precipitation, and temperature forecasting
- Produces forecasts in under 1 minute compared to hours/days for traditional numerical models
- Outperforms both specialized ML models and physics-based numerical weather prediction on several benchmarks

Results:
- 15-20% improvement in 5-day global air pollution predictions vs current methods
- Better performance on 10-day weather forecasts compared to specialized models
- Maintains accuracy even for extreme weather events
- Shows continual improvement as training data increases
- Successfully handles multiple spatial and temporal resolutions

I think this work could significantly change how we approach environmental modeling. Instead of maintaining separate models for different prediction tasks, having a single foundation model that can handle multiple atmospheric predictions could make forecasting more efficient and accessible. The speed improvements (minutes vs hours) could enable new applications requiring rapid predictions.

I think the challenges ahead include:
- Validating performance across more diverse atmospheric phenomena
- Understanding model interpretability for critical forecasting
- Addressing computational costs of training and inference
- Ensuring reliability for operational forecasting systems

TLDR: Researchers developed Aurora, an atmospheric foundation model trained on massive weather/climate data that can handle multiple prediction tasks better than specialized models while being much faster. Shows foundation models could transform environmental forecasting.

MachineLearning,[R] Evaluating Creative Writing Output and The Effects of Fine Tuning,"
I was asked by a publisher if GPT-4o could be fine tuned to match their authors style to help build a copilot type experience. 

This gave me a chance to figure out a way to breakdown creative writing into five pillars (Dialogue, Exposition, Inner Thoughts, Description and Action) and measure how these change with prompting and fine tuning. 

I put together this blog post based on the results of training on popular authors like J.K. Rowling, Tade Thompson and Andrei Agassi. Surprisingly based GPT-4o does a decent job adopting their style with prompting but I put together some interactive visualizations to see how the model shifts during story generation (400 paragraphs) as we fine tune on 300, 600, and 800 samples.

MachineLearning,[D] Flow matching is actually very different from (continuous) normalising flow?,"I was looking at the [flow matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02747) paper and saw that flow matching is often considered as just an alternative implementation of continuous normalising flow. But after comparing the methodologies more closely, it seems there is a very significant distinction. In the flow matching paper, it is mentioned that for a data sample x1 (I assume this refers to individual data points like a single image), we can put an ""dummy"" distribution such as a very tight Gaussian on it, then construct a conditional probability path p_t(x|x1). Therefore what we learn is a transformation between the small Gaussian (t=1) on the data point to a standard Gaussian (t=0), for every data point. This implies that the latent space, when trained over the entire dataset, is the overlapped mixture of all the standard Gaussians that each individual data point maps to. The image of the small Gaussian ball for each individual image is the entire standard Gaussian.

However this does not seem to be what we do with regular normalising flows. In normalising flows, we try to learn a mapping that transforms the ENTIRE distribution of the data to the standard Gaussian, such that each data point has a fixed location in the latent space, and jointly the image of the dataset is normally distributed in the latent space. In practice we may take minibatches and optimise a score (e.g. KL or MMD) that compares the image of the minibatch with a standard Gaussian. Each location in the latent space can be uniquely inverted to a fixed reconstructed data point.

I am not sure if I am missing anything, but this seems to be a significant distinction between the two methods. In NF the inputs are encoded in the latent space, whereas flow matching as described in the paper seems to MIX inputs in the latent space. If my observations are true, there should be a few implications:

1. You can semantically interpolate in NF latent space, but it is completely meaningless in the FM case
2. Batch size is important for NF training but not FM training
3. NF cannot be ""steered"" the same way as diffusion models or FM, because the target image is already determined the moment you sample the initial noise

I wonder if anyone here has also looked into these questions and can inform me whether this is indeed the case, or whether something I missed made them more similar de facto.

MachineLearning,[D] Looking for paper suggestions. What's your go to method for training a model on a mixture of multiple datasets with slightly different distributions?,"Imagine you have image data from different kinds of devices with different color profiles, resolutions, lens distortions etc. Or the object being captured in each dataset is similar but slightly different. I need suggestions on papers that effectively mix such datasets to get a bigger dataset for training a foundation model.

My datasets all come from slightly different distributions but they represent largely the same concepts so it makes sense to model them together for training a foundation model. But simply concatenating all datasets together without passing any metadata information to the model is degrading performance over training individually on each dataset.

For reference I am training MAE type models on unlabelled data and at test time training simple linear/logistic regression models on frozen MAE embeddings for different downstream tasks. The goal is to have the MAE embeddings outperform supervised models trained on each dataset individually.

An MAE trained on N datasets is underperforming an MAE trained on just one dataset. But an MAE trained on N-1 datasets and finetuned (unsupervisedly) on the Nth dataset before taking embeddings is outperforming a model trained on just the Nth dataset. But this is not a solution since I cant have N foundation models.

I tried adding a trainable source token (ie I have N trainable tokens and I concat the token corresponding to the data source to the masked input sequence before passing through the encoder) but it isn't affecting model performance at all.

MachineLearning,[D] As a CS masters student/researcher should one be very deliberate in picking a lab’s domain?,"I (very fortunately) got an opportunity in a great lab in an R1 school, Prof has a &gt;40 h-index, great record, but mainly published in lower tier conferences, though do some AAAI. It applies AI in a field that aligns with my experience, and we are expected to publish, which is perfect. However I’m more keen to explore more foundational AI research (where I have minimal experience in apart from courses I took).

In CS, ML it seems most people are only prioritising NIPS/ICLR/ICML especially since I’m interested in potentially pursuing a PhD. I’m in a bit of a dilemma, if I should seize the opportunity or keep looking for a more aligned lab (though other profs may not be looking for more students).

My gut tells me I should ignore conference rankings and do this, since they have some, chain of though, knowledge representation, cognitive system components.

MachineLearning,[R] Testing the Brittleness of LLM Analogical Reasoning Through Problem Variants,"The researchers developed a systematic framework for testing analogical reasoning in LLMs using letter-string analogies of increasing complexity. They created multiple test sets that probe different aspects of analogical thinking, from basic transformations to complex pattern recognition.

Key technical points:
- Evaluated performance across 4 major LLMs including GPT-4 and Claude
- Created test sets with controlled difficulty progression
- Implemented novel metrics for measuring analogy comprehension
- Tested both zero-shot and few-shot performance
- Introduced adversarial examples to test robustness

Main results:
- Models achieve &gt;90% accuracy on basic letter sequence transformations
- Performance drops 30-40% on multi-step transformations
- Accuracy falls below 50% on novel alphabet systems
- Few-shot prompting improves results by 15-20% on average
- Models show brittleness to small pattern perturbations

I think this work exposes important limitations in current LLMs' abstract reasoning capabilities. While they handle surface-level patterns well, they struggle with deeper analogical thinking. This suggests we need new architectures or training approaches to achieve more robust reasoning abilities.

The evaluation framework introduced here could help benchmark future models' reasoning capabilities in a more systematic way. The results also highlight specific areas where current models need improvement, particularly in handling novel patterns and multi-step transformations.

TLDR: New framework for testing analogical reasoning in LLMs using letter-string analogies shows strong performance on basic patterns but significant limitations with complex transformations and novel alphabets. Results suggest current models may be pattern-matching rather than truly reasoning.

MachineLearning,[D] Emergent Cognitive Pathways In Transformer Models. Addressing Fundamental Flaws About Limits.,"**TLDR:**

Cognitive functions like reasoning and creativity emerge as models scale and train on better data. Common objections crumble when we consider humans with unusual cognitive or sensory differences—or those with limited exposure to the world—who still reason, formulate novel thoughts, and build internal models of the world.

EDIT: It looks like I hallucinated the convex hull metric as a requirement for out of distribution tests. I thought I heard it in a Lex Fridman podcast with either LeCun or Chollet, but while both advocate for systems that can generalize beyond their training data, neither actually uses the convex hull metric as a distribution test. Apologies for the mischaracterization.

**OOD Myths and the Elegance of Function Composition**

Critics like LeCun and Chollet argue that LLMs can't extrapolate beyond their training data, ~~often citing convex hull measurements~~. This view misses a fundamental mathematical reality: novel distributions emerge naturally through function composition. When non-linear functions f and g combine as f(g(x)), they create outputs beyond the original training distributions. This is not a limitation but a feature of how neural networks generalize knowledge.

Consider a simple example: training on {poems, cat poems, Shakespeare} allows a model to generate ""poems about cats in Shakespeare's style""—a novel computational function blending distributions. Scale this up, and f and g could represent Bayesian statistics and geopolitical analysis, yielding insights neither domain alone could produce. Generalizing this principle reveals capabilities like reasoning, creativity, theory of mind, and other high-level cognitive functions.

**The Training Data Paradox**

We can see an LLM's training data but not our own experiential limits, leading to the illusion that human knowledge is boundless. Consider someone in 1600: their 'training data' consisted of their local environment and perhaps a few dozen books. Yet they could reason about unseen phenomena and create new ideas. The key isn't the size of the training set - it's how information is transformed and recombined.

**Persistent Memory Isn't Essential**

A common objection is that LLMs lack persistent memory and therefore can’t perform causal inference, reasoning, or creativity. Yet people with anterograde amnesia, who cannot form new memories, regularly demonstrate all these abilities using only their working memory. Similarly, LLMs use context windows as working memory analogs, enabling reasoning and creative synthesis without long-term memory.

**Lack of a World Model**

The subfield of mechanistic interpretation strongly implies by its existence alone, that transformers and neural networks do create models of the world. One claim is that words are not a proper sensory mechanism and so text-only LLMs can't possibly form a 3D model of the world.

Let's take the case of a blind and deaf person with limited proprioception who can read in Braille. It would be absurd to claim that because their main window into the world is just text from Braille, that they can't reason, be creative or build an internal model of the world. We know that's not true.

Just as a blind person constructs valid world models from Braille through learned transformations, LLMs build functional models through composition of learned patterns. What critics call 'hallucinations' are often valid explorations of these composed spaces - low probability regions that emerge from combining transformations in novel ways.

**Real Limitations**

While these analogies are compelling, true reflective reasoning might require recursive feedback loops or temporal encoding, which LLMs lack, though attention mechanisms and context windows provide partial alternatives. While LLMs currently lack true recursive reasoning or human-like planning, these reflect architectural constraints that future designs may address.

**Final Thoughts**

The non-linearity of feedforward networks and their high-dimensional spaces enables genuine novel outputs, verifiable through embedding analysis and distribution testing. Experiments like Golden Gate Claude, where researchers amplified specific neural pathways to explore novel cognitive spaces, demonstrate these principles in action. We don't say planes can't fly simply because they're not birds - likewise, LLMs can reason and create despite using different cognitive architectures than humans. We can probably approximate and identify other emergent cognitive features like Theory of Mind, Metacognition, Reflection as well as a few that humans may not possess.",ipassthebutteromg,1gys51e,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gys51e/d_emergent_cognitive_pathways_in_transformer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gys51e/d_emergent_cognitive_pathways_in_transformer/,2024-11-24 14:27:12,10,0.58,10,0,33,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gys51e

MachineLearning,[D] What is the current state-of-the-art for discrete diffusion models? ,"Hi everyone,

I am currently working with Discrete Diffusion models for a new research project. In this project, I am applying Discrete Diffusion to a field where it has yet to be applied. However, I am quite new to diffusion itself, and I am overwhelmed by the number of papers published on the topic. In my current implementation, I focussed on an older [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05379) since they described their approach quite well, and I wanted to test my idea first to see if it had some merit, which, according to initial results, it has.

Currently, I am looking at updating my method with more recent additions to this field, but as I said earlier, I am a bit overwhelmed by the amount. So my question to you is, what are good recent papers that looked into Discrete Diffusion that either explain essential concepts, such as survey papers, or that introduce new state-of-art methods that are not only applicable to a specific field, such as NLP or Vision?

Thank you in advance for your help.",Derpirium,1gyp1br,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gyp1br/d_what_is_the_current_stateoftheart_for_discrete/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gyp1br/d_what_is_the_current_stateoftheart_for_discrete/,2024-11-24 11:35:12,42,0.98,42,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gyp1br

MachineLearning,[P] Creating Custom Music Genres Using Unsupervised Learning ,"so i had this random thought to create new music genres/spotify daylists using unsupervised learning. my idea is more towards creating a custom genre but not something necessarily as hyper-personalized as daylists. this is very much just an idea for now, will be developing into it soon tho. so the idea is in two phases:

1. take music data with audio features/embeddings/mfccs/create own features and use unsupervised learning to create clusters of those using something like knns
2. take out the audio features of the centre of the clusters and feed that to an llm to generate a custom phrase/name for that particular cluster. this can be something customized like character names for a play/use data like what time frame particular clusters of songs were played more to create something a lil more personalized like daylists/anything for that matter. haven't given much thought into this part for now.

i found a lot of papers/articles for the former phase but couldn't find much for the latter as of now. i am reading more into how spotify makes their daylists to see if anything strikes of interest.

i would live to have suggestions on how this can be improved/ recommendations for research papers/articles on anything relevant to this.

MachineLearning,[D] Recommendations needed: image-to-3D diffusion models,"Hey all, I'm evaluating different open source image-to-3D diffusion models for a project and could use some real-world insights. I've been digging through papers but would love to hear from people who've actually implemented these.

My main requirements:

1. Quality is the top priority - looking for clean, accurate reconstructions
2. Need mesh-based output (not point clouds or neurals fields) that isn't astronomically large
3. Inference time isn't critical - happy to wait up to a minute per generation

I've looked at Zero123, Wonder3D, and a few others but curious what's working well for people in practice. Especially interested in:

* Which models are actually maintainable in production
* Any gotchas with mesh generation quality
* Real-world inference times you're seeing
* How much post-processing is typically needed

Would really appreciate hearing about your experiences, especially from anyone who's deployed these in actual projects.

MachineLearning,[R] Iterative Narrowing: A Visual Prompting Framework for Enhanced GUI Location Grounding,"This paper introduces an iterative narrowing approach for GUI element grounding that processes visual and textual information in multiple refinement steps rather than a single pass. The key insight is breaking down element identification into coarse-to-fine stages that mirror how humans visually search interfaces.

Key technical points:
* **Two-stage architecture**: Initial region proposal network followed by focused refinement
*  Visual and text encoders process features in parallel before cross-attention alignment
* Progressive narrowing through multiple passes reduces false positives
* Handles nested GUI elements through hierarchical representation
* Trained on a dataset of 77K GUI screenshots with natural language queries

Results show:
* 15% improvement in grounding accuracy vs single-pass baseline
* Better handling of ambiguous queries
* Reduced computational overhead compared to exhaustive search
* Strong performance on complex nested interfaces
* Effective transfer to unseen GUI layouts

I think this approach could meaningfully improve accessibility tools and GUI automation by making element identification more robust. The iterative refinement mirrors human visual search patterns, which could lead to more natural interaction with interfaces.

I think the main limitation is handling highly dynamic interfaces, where elements move or change frequently. The multi-pass nature also introduces some latency that would need optimization for real-time applications.

TLDR: New GUI grounding method uses multiple refinement passes to identify interface elements more accurately, achieving 15% better accuracy through an approach that mimics human visual search patterns.

MachineLearning,[D] Optimization Algorithm that focuses on solving model parameters ,"i tried googling for any sources but does anyone have info on where i can start looking for optimization algorithms that focus on optimizing model parameters by solving for a specific parameter (or parameters), given the input and target for a sample? Or the name for this kind of optimization algorithm? E.g. solve for model parameters a,b,c for the function y = ax\^2 + bx + c , x and y being the input and target respectively. Surely this algorithm has a name in the context of ml.

EDIT:

I believe what im asking is a bit ambiguous. As opposed to gradient descent, which focuses on finding the derivative of model parameters to the loss provided, the optimization algorithm i specified above focuses on a number of parameters and somehow figures out (or solves the values of these parameters) to approximately match the output. Like the same way you have 5x = 10 and solve for x, so the algortithm figures that x=2. For more data samples and more parameters you have 5x + c = 12 and 2x + c = 6, x and c being model parameters and 10 ad 4 being the desired output. The algorithm figures x = 2 and c = 2 somehow. Its a bit of a stretch but even im starting to doubt my sanity enough to believe that what im asking is basically all if not most of what ml optimization algorithms do.",Relevant-Twist520,1gy6jy6,https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gy6jy6/d_optimization_algorithm_that_focuses_on_solving/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gy6jy6/d_optimization_algorithm_that_focuses_on_solving/,2024-11-23 18:40:43,0,0.42,0,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1gy6jy6

MachineLearning,[R] Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues,"
Abstract:
Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers in large language modeling, offering linear scaling with sequence length and improved training efficiency. However, LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation or tracking a chess game. Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like LSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to [0,1]  and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs, which have recently shown promise in models such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo 3. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range [-1,1]. Our empirical results confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with an extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable performance and stability while showing promise on code and math data. Our work enhances the expressivity of modern LRNNs, broadening their applicability without changing the cost of training or inference.
