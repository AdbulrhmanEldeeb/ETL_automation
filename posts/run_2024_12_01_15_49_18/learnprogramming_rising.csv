learnprogramming,How to write Pseudocode in an efficient way?,"I have to learn pseudocode for some exams and I really feel like it's harder than simply writing programming-code. Since we can't use a specific language, I always end up writing everything way more verbosely, because it feels like pseudocode is meant to still be very exact and also easy to understand for non-programmers.

I like programming for the clear structure and rules. So I basically want the same for pseudocode.

I mainly program in Java und Kotlin, but also know some Python. Python seems quite well-suited for pseudocode. So I might want to basically write Python with some Kotlin, where Python is less expressive (e.g. fun instead of def for functions).

Do you have tipps and rules for efficient and readable pseudocode, that doesn't take an eternity to think about or write down?

**Examples with Python + Kotlin for Pseudocode**

Write a function that takes two numbers from the user and prints out the sum of those.

    fun add():
      set x = input
      set y = input
    
      print(x + y)

learnprogramming,My Programming Learning Journey: Struggling with Syntax and Cognitive Load After Two Years of Consistent Effort,"I've been seriously learning programming for over two years now, with a particularly intense period of daily coding and study since summer 2023. My ""uptime"" has been close to about 98% — I'm committed, but something fundamental feels broken in how I learn

Every time I start something new, it feels like pure torture. Whether it's a new stack or technology, the process drains the life out of me. Learning seems like a constant battle where every single step is either a snag or a stumbling block

My Learning Process:

\- I break down tutorial videos into tiny 7-minute segments

\- Take extremely detailed notes (down to the dot)

\- Rewatch these segments multiple times

\- Spend literally 30 minutes of real life analyzing just one minute of video

\- Despite all this effort, I retain maybe 1/20 of the information



The most frustrating part? Others seem to breeze through content by binge-watching, while I'm meticulously dissecting every moment and still feeling lost



Current Focus: Frontend development, currently wrestling with advanced Redux (RTK)



Biggest Challenge: Syntax retention. I understand logic most of the time, but remembering syntax feels impossible. Even after breaking concepts down into minute, simple parts, the connections remain fuzzy.



I've tried everything:

\- Detailed note-taking

\- Repeated viewing

\- Breaking down concepts

\- Intensive study sessions



But documentation feels like a foreign language. YouTube tutorials often show workarounds different from docs, making everything more confusing. I can spend 14 days, 5 hours daily on a 50-minute video and still only grasp a vague understanding.



Emotional Toll:

It feels like I'm constantly hitting my head against a wall. Each new technology seems like an entirely different world, and the learning curve appears almost vertical.



I'm not looking for sympathy, but insight. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you break through this seemingly impenetrable wall of learning?



Hoping to find some strategies and understanding.

learnprogramming,Need Help with Banker’s Algorithm: Minimal Resources for a Safe State,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a problem involving the Banker’s Algorithm, and I’m stuck on determining the smallest value of x for which the system is in a safe state. Here’s the problem setup:

**Problem Description:**

The system has 4 processes and 5 allocatable resources. The current allocation, maximum needs, and available resources are as follows:

|Process|Allocation|Max|Available|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P0|1 0 2 1 1|1 2 1 3| 0 0 x 1 2|
|P1|2 0 1 1 0|2 2 1 0||
|P2|1 1 0 1 0|2 1 3 1 0||
|P3|1 1 1 1 0|1 2 2 2 1||

**Objective:**

What is the smallest value of x such that this is a safe state?

**Hints provided:**

1. Compute the ""needs matrix"" (Need=Max−Allocation).
2. Identify the process that can complete first if x is sufficiently large.

I’ve calculated the needs matrix and tried different values for x, but I’m not entirely sure how to proceed with finding the exact smallest x that ensures the system remains in a safe state. I’d appreciate if someone could guide me through the steps or point me to resources that explain this process in detail.

Thanks in advance for your help!

**What I’ve Tried So Far:**

* Calculated the needs matrix:
   * Need\[i\]\[j\]=Max\[i\]\[j\]-Allocation\[i\]\[j\],
      * where i represents the process number, j represents the resource type. The Max matrix indicates the maximum demand of each resource for each process. The Allocation matrix indicates the resources currently allocated to each process.
   * For each process Pᵢ and each resource Rⱼ, subtract the allocated resources from the maximum demand:  
      * Need ᵢⱼ=Max ᵢⱼ−Allocation ᵢⱼ 

# 

|Process|Allocation (A)|Max (M)|Need (M - A)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P0|\[1,0,2,1,1\]|\[1,1,2,1,3\]|\[0,1,0,0,2\]|
|P1​|\[2,0,1,1,0\]|\[2,2,2,1,0\]|\[0,2,1,0,0\]|
|P2​|\[1,1,0,1,0\]|\[2,1,3,1,0\]|\[1,0,3,0,0\]|
|P3​|\[1,1,1,1,0\]|\[1,1,2,2,1\]|\[0,0,1,1,1\]|

Now, given the availability vector, we know that R₁=0, R₂=0, R₄=1, R₆=2 are fixed, but we want to determine R₃.

A process can execute if its resource requirements (from the Needs Matrix) are less than or equal to the resources currently available. For each process Pᵢ, we check if:  

Need\[i\]\[j\] ≤ Available \[j\] ∀j   

Where:

− Need\[i\]\[j\] is the need of process Pᵢ for resource Rⱼ.

− Available \[j\] is the current availability of resource Rⱼ.

If Need(P₀)=\[0,1,0,0,2\], then:

\- For R₁: 0 ≤ 0 (satisfied)

\- For R₂: 1 ≤ 0 (not satisfied, so P₀ cannot run yet),

\- For R₃: 0 ≤ x (always satisfied because 0 ≤ x for any x ),

\- For R₄: 0 ≤ 1 (satisfied),

\- For R₅: 2 ≤ 2 (satisfied).

Since all conditions are not satisfied, do we state that P₀ cannot run? Do we repeat this calculation process for the other P's? But I am not sure how we get to the point of determining the smallest x.

Any help is appreciated!",Fre5h_J4,1h3wk46,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h3wk46/need_help_with_bankers_algorithm_minimal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1h3wk46/need_help_with_bankers_algorithm_minimal/,2024-12-01 05:51:22,3,1.0,3,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Operating Systems,,t3_1h3wk46
