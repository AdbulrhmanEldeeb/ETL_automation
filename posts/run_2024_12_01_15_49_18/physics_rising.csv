I still reminisce about the late nights in labs, study groups, and the joy of learning with friends. I wanted to do a PhD but couldn’t stand the 7-year slog of academic bureaucracy. Recently, I’ve been diving back into my undergrad notes to relearn and keep my mind sharp.

Physics,"What is the Main Motivation for Weak Scale Supersymmetry (SUSY) After the Negative Results from the LHC, XENONnT, Searches for Proton Decay, EDM, etc.?","SUSY is an attractive (and natural) property to have for our world especially if we want to build a theory of quantum gravity (vis-a-vis, superstring theory, supergravity etc.). And I understand the basic motivation behind it too, why would nature, after all, not utilize spin 3/2 when she already utilizes the others (0, 1/2, 1, 2). However, for quantum gravity we only need SUSY at the Planck scale NOT at the Weak scale. So massively broken SUSY is not an issue for quantum gravity.

From my understanding the original motivation some 40 years ago for expecting Weak scale (slightly broken) SUSY was as follows:
1. The so-called WIMP miracle, a candidate for dark matter,
2. Exact unification of the coupling constants at GUT scale,
3. Fixing the Heirarchy problem and the Higgs mass,
4. 'Improving' the discrepancy in the cosmological constant problem.

(If I have understood these incorrectly or if you want to add more reasons, feel free to correct me!)

Now, from what I understand the non-detection of SUSY or WIMPs at the LHC and dark matter experiments (with XENONnT, LZ, etc., now hitting the neutrino floor), along with the growing limits on proton decay and EDM for SUSY models, we are reaching the limits of what SUSY was intended to fix in the first place!

So, my question is, am I missing something from this picture? Is there still any good motivation for Weak scale SUSY?",canweaffordstickers,1h40qte,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h40qte/what_is_the_main_motivation_for_weak_scale/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1h40qte/what_is_the_main_motivation_for_weak_scale/,2024-12-01 10:47:24,9,0.78,9,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h40qte

Recently, I just feel like I can no longer understand some of the latest trends or news in the Physics field. Is there any way that I can keep up even as an amateur?

Physics,I Wrote a Guide to Simulation in Python with SimPy,"Hi folks,

I wrote a guide on discrete-event simulation with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to help you learn how to build simulations using Python. Kind of like the official documentation but on steroids.

I have used SimPy personally in my own career for over a decade, it was central in helping me build a [pretty successful engineering career](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1gh8at0/my_13_year_nontraditional_meche_career_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling real world industrial systems such as factories, mines, railways, etc.

My latest venture is teaching others all about this.

If you do get the guide, I’d really appreciate any feedback you have. Feel free to drop your thoughts here in the thread or DM me directly!

Here’s the link to get the guide: [https://simulation.teachem.digital/free-simulation-in-python-guide](https://simulation.teachem.digital/free-simulation-in-python-guide)

For full transparency, why do I ask for your email?

Well I’m working on a full course following on from my previous [Udemy course on Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-engineers-scientists-and-analysts/?referralCode=8E30A5C432085F42D090). This new course will be all about real-world modelling and simulation with SimPy, and I’d love to keep you in the loop via email. If you found the guide helpful you would might be interested in the course.
