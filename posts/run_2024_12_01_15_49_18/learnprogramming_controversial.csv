learnprogramming,"Self taught programmer for ~10 years, feeling completely lost","Hello, I‚Äôm a self taught programmer.

I‚Äôm now 17 and feeling like i have never really accomplished anything important. 
I tried reading books about machine learning, but i felt those were too overwhelming.

learnprogramming,MIMXRT1024 webserver,"Hello everyone. I'm looking for someone who could help me crack and understand an assignment I've been given for my school.

The assignment:
Run a webserver on a MIMXRT1024-evk board and use CGI to make an LED blink on the board upon user input.

I was able to run the webserver using the sdk lwip_httpsrv_freertos example. I was also able to run my own html/css/js files on it. What I'm struggling is the last part - connecting the button on my website to the physical board and making the LED blink.
I'm not a very experienced programmer and I don't work well with other peoples code (ie. the example), there's a lot of stuff I don't understand and I don't know where and how to  configure the LED settings.

learnprogramming,How to write Pseudocode in an efficient way?,"I have to learn pseudocode for some exams and I really feel like it's harder than simply writing programming-code. Since we can't use a specific language, I always end up writing everything way more verbosely, because it feels like pseudocode is meant to still be very exact and also easy to understand for non-programmers.

I like programming for the clear structure and rules. So I basically want the same for pseudocode.

I mainly program in Java und Kotlin, but also know some Python. Python seems quite well-suited for pseudocode. So I might want to basically write Python with some Kotlin, where Python is less expressive (e.g. fun instead of def for functions).

Do you have tipps and rules for efficient and readable pseudocode, that doesn't take an eternity to think about or write down?

**Examples with Python + Kotlin for Pseudocode**

Write a function that takes two numbers from the user and prints out the sum of those.

    fun add():
      set x = input
      set y = input
    
      print(x + y)

learnprogramming,How to Efficiently Convert a 250MB CSV File with 1 Million Rows to XLSX in AWS S3,"# Problem:

I'm working on a project where I need to **convert large CSV files (250MB, with 1 million+ rows)** to **XLSX format** and save them back to **AWS S3**. The CSV is stored in an S3 bucket, and I‚Äôm trying to do the conversion directly from S3 without downloading the file locally due to its large size.

However, I‚Äôm facing performance issues, as processing and converting these large files takes a lot of time. My current approach is based on **Node.js**, using libraries like `xlsx`, `fast-csv`, and **AWS SDK** for reading and writing to S3.

# What I‚Äôve Tried:

1. **Streaming the CSV file**: I‚Äôve tried using `fast-csv` to stream the file and process it in chunks. However, I still face memory and performance bottlenecks when writing the data to XLSX, especially with large files.
2. **Worker Threads**: I‚Äôve attempted to parallelize processing by using **worker threads** to handle chunks of the CSV data. This doesn‚Äôt seem to improve the performance significantly.
3. **Buffering Issues**: I am encountering issues related to **buffers**, **memory consumption**, and **XLSX formatting**, as writing each row to the workbook one by one leads to significant delays, particularly with over a million rows.
4. // Example of my approach to processing CSV and converting to XLSX
5. const { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
6. const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker\_threads');
7. const fastcsv = require('fast-csv');
8. const xlsx = require('xlsx');
9. const { PassThrough } = require('stream');
10. const s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });
11. const bucketName = 'my-bucket';
12. const inputFileKey = 'path/to/my-csv.csv';
13. const outputFileKey = 'output\_data.xlsx';
14. function processCSVInChunks() {
15.   // Reading CSV from S3, then converting and writing to XLSX
16. }
17. function processBatch(rows) {
18.   // Worker thread for processing batches

All the code it has illustrates new concepts, so I can't know the solution.

To be honest, even if it had exercises, I just don't love reading in front of a computer, so in that case I would probably still read all the explanations on the bus, and then do the exercises when I'm home. And that's if I couldn't figure them out just in my head, because, again, I don't expect to apply my knowledge practically, so I don't think deep knowledge is necessary.

learnprogramming,My Programming Learning Journey: Struggling with Syntax and Cognitive Load After Two Years of Consistent Effort,"I've been seriously learning programming for over two years now, with a particularly intense period of daily coding and study since summer 2023. My ""uptime"" has been close to about 98% ‚Äî I'm committed, but something fundamental feels broken in how I learn

Every time I start something new, it feels like pure torture. Whether it's a new stack or technology, the process drains the life out of me. Learning seems like a constant battle where every single step is either a snag or a stumbling block

My Learning Process:

\- I break down tutorial videos into tiny 7-minute segments

\- Take extremely detailed notes (down to the dot)

\- Rewatch these segments multiple times

\- Spend literally 30 minutes of real life analyzing just one minute of video

\- Despite all this effort, I retain maybe 1/20 of the information



The most frustrating part? Others seem to breeze through content by binge-watching, while I'm meticulously dissecting every moment and still feeling lost



Current Focus: Frontend development, currently wrestling with advanced Redux (RTK)



Biggest Challenge: Syntax retention. I understand logic most of the time, but remembering syntax feels impossible. Even after breaking concepts down into minute, simple parts, the connections remain fuzzy.



I've tried everything:

\- Detailed note-taking

\- Repeated viewing

\- Breaking down concepts

\- Intensive study sessions



But documentation feels like a foreign language. YouTube tutorials often show workarounds different from docs, making everything more confusing. I can spend 14 days, 5 hours daily on a 50-minute video and still only grasp a vague understanding.



Emotional Toll:

It feels like I'm constantly hitting my head against a wall. Each new technology seems like an entirely different world, and the learning curve appears almost vertical.



I'm not looking for sympathy, but insight. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you break through this seemingly impenetrable wall of learning?

learnprogramming,I got this question in an OA 1 months back.,"I am unable to get all permutations of the string that is divided into m parts.  
Joe has organized a party for M guests and has planned a party game. In the game, Joe gives everyone a string S and explains to them the rules to play the game. The rules to play the game are as follows The string S needs to be distributed among the M guests, and each guest must get at least one character. The smallest lexicographical distribution of the string S among the M guests must be stored. Out of all the stored smallest lexicographical distributions, the largest lexicographical string must be found for distributing ""good"" and the number of guests are 3. Here are all possible ways in which you can distribute the string among 3 guests: ((o, o, dg), (oo, d, g), (o, do, g), (o, d, go), (o, d, og), (o, gd, o), (o, od, g)\] Now, the lexicographically smallest strings among all these distributions are   
(o, o, dg)-dg  
(oo, d, g)-d  
(o, d, go)-d   
(o, d, og)-d   
(o, gd, o)-gd   
(o, od, g)-g   
After comparing all the lexicographically smallest strings of every distribution, ""gd"" is the lexicographically strongest string. Hence, gd is returned as the output.  


Here I am unable to find an efficient way to get the distributions. I asked ai assistants but they also failed to give a solution.

learnprogramming,Coding  a native application to find lyrics in music files,"Hi everyone!

Yes, I read the FAQ, yes I've researched the topic for a while and still haven't reached a conclusive answer. Maybe my search terms are wrong, maybe I am not good at this. Anyhow...

I'm starting a personal project to build a native application (for Linux, ideally) that can determine if a song has lyrics. I find music helpful to focus, but lyrics can be distracting.

Currently my solution is just listening to bits and pieces of the songs and sorting them efficiently, but manually using a bash script.

I'm hoping to create a program that can analyze audio files and identify whether or not they contain significant amounts of vocal content (lyrics). Ideally, the program would analyse the whole library and write a commentary in the metadata of each track.

However, I'm stuck on the technical side. I'm not sure what technologies would be best suited for this task. Does anyone have experience with developing programs that analyze audio for vocal content? Are there established libraries or frameworks I should be looking into? Is this even feasible?  
I'm particularly interested in:

Possible technologies: e.g., libraries for audio analysis

Existing solutions: if any already exist and I just haven't stumbled upon them. Proprietary and even expensive programs might be worth it, but it has to be processed locally.

Potential challenges: things I might not have considered

learnprogramming,best next baby step for someone that has a very specific project but lacks focus when learning. ,"So I have a project I'm working on, not thinking about working on, as steely dan would say ""I've already bought the dream"" so its too late to change direction. what I need help with is; whats the next step in learning for a guy in my position with my project? The project is a C++ based touch screen OS for a raspberry pi that can:  
   
A: be a radio, USB storage stereo and bluetooth stereo while outputting audio to an amplifier.   
B: accept 0-5v input from sensors for referencing fuel+boost pressure and manifold pressure to precisely change motor speed via PWM to correct fuel pressure as required.   
C: have a settings page.   
D: run a second display with a gauge cluster.   
E: control HVAC via a second smaller touch screen. 

The reasons I'm not using openauto for this are as follows:

A: as far as I know open auto requires an ECU to communicate with, this is a mechanical fuel system with electronic monitoring and pressure regulation.   
B: I want the HVAC system to be separate because I hope to make it a product available to the public on it's own some day. its an open source mini mostly 3d-printable(heater core housing should really be metal) HVAC system for racecars. sounds corny but there's a lot of local interest.   
C: I need to write, model and come up with all my own original code in order to avoid being sued or to avoid gigantic licensing fees. 

I was going to learn about wxwidgets and get an idea of how to start the gui then I kinda stopped and asked myself ""if i go with wxwidgets, am I going to learn a whole bunch of stuff I can't use?""

learnprogramming,Need Help with Banker‚Äôs Algorithm: Minimal Resources for a Safe State,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm working on a problem involving the Banker‚Äôs Algorithm, and I‚Äôm stuck on determining the smallest value of¬†x¬†for which the system is in a safe state. Here‚Äôs the problem setup:

**Problem Description:**

The system has 4 processes and 5 allocatable resources. The current allocation, maximum needs, and available resources are as follows:

|Process|Allocation|Max|Available|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P0|1 0 2 1 1|1 2 1 3|¬†0 0 x 1 2|
|P1|2 0 1 1 0|2 2 1 0||
|P2|1 1 0 1 0|2 1 3 1 0||
|P3|1 1 1 1 0|1 2 2 2 1||

**Objective:**

What is the smallest value of¬†x¬†such that this is a safe state?

**Hints provided:**

1. Compute the ""needs matrix"" (Need=Max‚àíAllocation).
2. Identify the process that can complete first if¬†x¬†is sufficiently large.

I‚Äôve calculated the needs matrix and tried different values for¬†x, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to proceed with finding the exact smallest¬†x¬†that ensures the system remains in a safe state. I‚Äôd appreciate if someone could guide me through the steps or point me to resources that explain this process in detail.

Thanks in advance for your help!

**What I‚Äôve Tried So Far:**

* Calculated the needs matrix:
   * Need\[i\]\[j\]=Max\[i\]\[j\]-Allocation\[i\]\[j\],
      * where i¬†represents the process number, j¬†represents the resource type. The Max matrix indicates the maximum demand of each resource for each process. The Allocation matrix indicates the resources currently allocated to each process.
   * For each process P·µ¢ and each resource R‚±º, subtract the allocated resources from the maximum demand: ¬†
      * Need ·µ¢‚±º=Max ·µ¢‚±º‚àíAllocation ·µ¢‚±º¬†

# 

|Process|Allocation (A)|Max (M)|Need (M - A)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P0|\[1,0,2,1,1\]|\[1,1,2,1,3\]|\[0,1,0,0,2\]|
|P1‚Äã|\[2,0,1,1,0\]|\[2,2,2,1,0\]|\[0,2,1,0,0\]|
|P2‚Äã|\[1,1,0,1,0\]|\[2,1,3,1,0\]|\[1,0,3,0,0\]|
|P3‚Äã|\[1,1,1,1,0\]|\[1,1,2,2,1\]|\[0,0,1,1,1\]|

Now, given the availability vector, we know that R‚ÇÅ=0, R‚ÇÇ=0, R‚ÇÑ=1, R‚ÇÜ=2 are fixed, but we want to determine R‚ÇÉ.

A process can execute if its resource requirements (from the Needs Matrix) are less than or equal to the resources currently available. For each process P·µ¢, we check if: ¬†

Need\[i\]\[j\] ‚â§ Available \[j\] ‚àÄj¬† ¬†

Where:

‚àí Need\[i\]\[j\] is the need of process P·µ¢ for resource R‚±º.

‚àí Available \[j\] is the current availability of resource R‚±º.

If Need(P‚ÇÄ)=\[0,1,0,0,2\], then:

\- For R‚ÇÅ: 0 ‚â§ 0 (satisfied)

\- For R‚ÇÇ: 1 ‚â§ 0 (not satisfied, so P‚ÇÄ cannot run yet),

\- For R‚ÇÉ: 0 ‚â§ x (always satisfied because 0 ‚â§ x for any x ),

\- For R‚ÇÑ: 0 ‚â§ 1 (satisfied),

\- For R‚ÇÖ: 2 ‚â§ 2 (satisfied).

Since all conditions are not satisfied, do we state that P‚ÇÄ cannot run? Do we repeat this calculation process for the other P's? But I am not sure how we get to the point of determining the smallest x.

learnprogramming,What are the job opportunities for a bachelor‚Äôs in CIT,"I‚Äôm a high school senior currently in the process of applying for college. I‚Äôve always wanted to do something with computer since I was a child, and though I am by no means a programming expert, I would like a programming heavy job. 

I‚Äôm currently torn between two degrees.
Computer Science (CS) and Computer and Information Technology (CIT). I know that CS is the more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù degree, and the bare minimum requirement for most software engineering, but I‚Äôm terrible at math and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd handle the calculus classes required to earn the degree. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking at CIT as an alternative. The classes my local university offers seem specifically tailored to different areas, including web design, video game development, and mobile app development. It seems like a good alternative, but I‚Äôm also not entirely sure what programming jobs I can get with it. IT looks temping but I know i wouldn‚Äôt be doing a lot of actual programming. 

Should I just bite the bullet and major in CS and hope the math classes don‚Äôt turn me off, or is CIT still a viable option for someone looking for a programming centric job?

learnprogramming,Seeking advice on handling images and optimize costs in my ASP.NET App,"I apologize for asking you guys to ""solve"" my problem.  
I'll try to provide some context first.

I recently created a rudimentary application with 2 components:

1. A frontend application that has 2 pages and that fetches car entities from firebase. - 1 overview page that displays said cars through pagination. - 1 page to display one particular car entity and all its details.
2. A .NET desktop application to upload car data + images to firebase.

A problem is that the load time for the images is extremely big, the overview page takes 7-8+ seconds to load.  
Each entity has \~10 images and the overview page initially loads 6 entities, so that's 60 images. Small edit -&gt; I did use compression for the images fetched on the overview, it did not improve load times in a noticeable way.

I'm using a free tier version of hosting for the frontend application and as well for firestore and firebase storage so I can't complain about speed but few other concerns did pop in my head aaaand long story short and after a bit of research I'm now currently trying to steer towards a full stack .net application instead that I will probably host on Azure.

Now, below are my plans, concerns and questions where I do need some feedback. :&lt;

One of the most concerning things is optimizing the bandwidth for all the data transfers regarding images, I would like to carefully approach this.  
Some safety guards against malicious users spamming requests are also welcomed, I'm not sure if this will even be a real problem.  
Ultimately, decent loading times are also important.

I'll try to somehow arrange my plans based on the topic.

A. Due to the simplicity of the application my current plan revolves around creating a [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC Web App and using a Linux container to host it in Azure as an app service.

B. The total amount of data that I will have is really small, around 50-100 car entities at max.  
For storing the images I'll most probably go with azure blob storage but for storing the car entity details I'm not sure. I would only need two tables. One holding the car details and the other having all the references to the images blob storage images, both with few records.  
Is using the storage provided by App Service a viable alternative?

C. My application doesn't target users from different regions/countries. However, I've read Azure CDN can optimize bandwidth usage and load times.  
Is a CDN necessary for this application?

D. How can I protect myself against malicious users?  
Sorry if this is a extremely stupid question but are there any built-in safeguards for someone spamming million requests to fetch images from the blob storage?  
How to handle this kind of issue?

E. I assume caching is essential for this, it will help optimizing data transfer and costs.  
Any tips for implementing caching effectively for this?

F. COSTS... after all, is going full Azure a good idea for this?  
While I don't want to cut corners unnecessarily I would prefer to approach this in a smart way.  
Unfortunately, my lack of experience is showing.

How would you approach this? Are the technologies/cloud provider I chose suitable for my context?

I will HIGHLY appreciate any kind of input about this.
