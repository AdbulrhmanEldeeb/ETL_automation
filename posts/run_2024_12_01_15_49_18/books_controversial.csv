books,"Son's prof taught them that The Hobbit is misogynistic because of lack of female characters and I am confused, outraged, and heartbroken","I love *The Hobbit*. It is one of my favourite childhood books, and favourite books ever. I read and reread it as a child till I knew chunks of it by heart, I still do. It is part of my emotional / mental landscape, along with a few other works (and unlike that godawful sprawling Lord of the Ring shite, which I sludged through at the age of fifteen out of a sense of duty, and never touched again). When my son was little, I remember telling him bits of *The Hobbit* (the escape with the eagles, the spiders, Gollum, Smaug) as bedtime stories. 

So when he (now a 19-year old who of course knows everything about everything) was assigned *The Hobbit* in a Pop Culture course (he's in maths, but he needs to take some mandatary writing/humanities credits, and this one happened to fit his schedule), I was delighted. I always love it when my children read the books I did as a child, and I envisaged lots of cozy conversation between us about how wonderful *The Hobbit* is. I was worried he would hate it (remembering an unfortunate episode where my daughter, then 13, declared Lloyd Alexander's Prydain to be sexist and Taran beyond annoying, and refused to finish the series)

Well, my son also fell in love with *The Hobbit*! That was marvelous! He loved Bilbo, he related to him, being pressured to go do ""fun"" things with friends who are bigger taller stronger cooler than he is, the adventures, Bilbo's wit and survival instincts, all of it! We did indeed have lots of conversations, and I read his essays and ended up reading the Fafnir mythology- all good. 

Then, a couple of nights ago, he is studying for finals, and he mentions the OP title. That the prof says *The Hobbit* is misogynistic because it doesn't have female characters. 

Now, I grew up in an academic family, and although not an academic myself, I have orbitted academia for many years, so I am absolutely used to hearing profs spout dumb things, like, all the time. But really? Like, how stupid are we talking? 

Not living in a hole like Bilbo, and indeed being an enthusiastic consumer of Pop Culture, I am of course aware of the trend, and hopefully not just a trend! of casting all sorts of characters with diverse backgrounds, abilities, sexualities, and genders, and it's all good! I love it! You will never catch foaming at the mouth that Ariel is Black! Go for it!

But now I *am* metaphorically foaming at the mouth. Beloved works are judged, in an incompetent and self-serving way, by standards never agreed to, never even knew about.

Let me make it clear (maybe, hopefully, the prof is on Reddit??), simply not having characters of different genders, races, abilities, does not make a book ""against"" those identities. Writing about creatures of similar identities does not make you ""against"" the identities not written about. Does your work preach hatred, othering, narrow-mindedness, bigotry and various phobias? Then it is not \[insert identity\]-phobic. Does *The Hobbit* explicitly or implicitly say women are lesser than men, and should be differently treated as a result of that? No? Then it's not misogynistic. Simply writing about what is essentially a boys' trip is not misogynistic.

Anyway, the nice thing was, my son did not agree with prof! So clearly I have done my work well :)

books,Dune book is just spoiling my reading interest!! ,"I am 400 pages into the book. The story is great, the world building, the houses, the planets all are great. I know what is going in the story but it's very very boring. I can't read it because of the complex words....I have to look again again in dictionary for the words , i just cant read the full page without searching in dictionary. I thought that when paul and his mother will go into the desert it will be very easy to read but it became more complex. I cant understand the places he is explaining... Like ""They came to a series of dropping shelves and beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule"". And now i cant understand the part where paul pack is lost in the fissure , how he find it using compass and spice and water. Usually when i like a book i always think about it whole day what is going to happen , also at nights i will think about it , will wake to read at night, my morning will start with reading. The book is just spoiling the interest for my reading. I really want to finish it but i cantttt. ‘I **cannot** make anyone understand what **is happening** inside me.

books,Why Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy is a deeply unsettling work of fiction,"This book is wild. Just reading the back cover, I knew I was in for something crazy, but *Outer Dark* surpassed even my wildest expectations.

*Outer Dark* back cover:

*""A woman bears her brother's child, a boy; he leaves the baby in the woods and tells her he died of natural causes. Discovering her brother's lie, she sets forth alone to find her son. Both brother and sister wander separately through a countryside being scourged by three terrifying and elusive strangers, headlong toward an eerie, apocalyptic resolution.""*

This is an extremely dark read, but I loved every word McCarthy wrote. It was fantastic.

As I mentioned in my review of All the Pretty Horses, Cormac McCarthy is probably my favourite author. *Outer Dark* continues to reinforce that belief.

Interestingly, as I started reading *Outer Dark*, a Vanity Fair article surfaced claiming that Cormac McCarthy had a 16-year-old muse late in his life. While I haven’t been able to access the full article due to subscription barriers, the excerpts and discussions I’ve encountered paint the piece as overly stylized, almost as if the author is attempting to mimic McCarthy’s own prose. This stylistic choice, combined with the extraordinary claims made, makes the story feel exaggerated, if not dubious. I’m not dismissing the possibility that some of it might be true—if it is, it’s deeply troubling—but the lack of concrete evidence and the outlandish nature of certain allegations leave me skeptical. It’s also worth noting that McCarthy is no longer alive to respond or clarify these claims. While the article has sparked debates about separating art from the artist, I believe McCarthy’s literary contributions remain vital. His works deserve to be read and analyzed, even as we remain mindful of the complexities surrounding his personal life.

Now, back to *Outer Dark*.

This is an amazing piece of fiction. From the very beginning, the book is relentlessly dark. Set in Appalachia, McCarthy creates an eerie, almost fantastical world that feels alive in its desolation. The brother and sister live in an isolated shack deep in the woods, and when they venture out on their separate journeys, they encounter a cast of vivid and unforgettable characters. Some of these figures are helpful, while others are downright malevolent. These secondary characters breathe so much life—and death—into the story, amplifying its intensity.

The first time Culla Holme, the brother, meets the three elusive strangers face-to-face, right after his ride on the ferry, is one of the creepiest scenes I’ve ever read. The way McCarthy describes the shadows moving in the clearing and the strangers’ unsettling mannerisms—how they move, stare, laugh, and speak—is masterful. The tension is almost unbearable.

You know they’ll return, and when they do, McCarthy doesn’t disappoint.

*""Well, I see ye didn't have no trouble findin us.*  
*I wasn't huntin ye.*  
*You got here all right for somebody bound elsewhere.*  
*I wasn't bound nowheres. I just seen the fire.*  
*I like to keep a good fire. A man never knows what all might chance along. Does he?*  
*No.*  
*No. Anything's liable to warsh up. From nowheres nowhere bound.*  
*Where are you bound? Holme said.*  
*I ain't, the man said. By nothin. He looked up at Holme. We ain't hard to find. Oncet you've found us.""*

This scene is haunting, and when the strangers appear again—with the one-eyed baby and the tinker in the tree—the atmosphere is downright terrifying. I’m not sure if *Outer Dark* is officially considered a horror novel, but it’s probably the scariest book I’ve ever read.

I’m not a big horror reader. People rave about Stephen King, but I haven’t been impressed. I’ve read *The Dead Zone* and *The Shining*, and neither really did it for me. I actually prefer Kubrick’s adaptation of *The Shining* because it improved on the source material in tone and execution. That said, I love Dan Simmons, I mostly know him as a science fiction author, however, I read Drood and loved it, though it wasn’t the horror elements that hooked me. If you have horror recommendations, I’d love to explore more.

But *Outer Dark*? It qualifies as horror in my book.

Religious themes also run deep in this story, coming to the forefront in the latter half. One of the most memorable scenes is when Holme meets the hog drovers. After one of their brothers dies and Holme gets blamed, a preacher shows up, declaring his guilt without any knowledge of the situation. The absurdity of this preacher, casually pronouncing judgment, is both comical and thought-provoking—a sharp critique of blind religious authority.

Rinthy Holme, Culla’s sister, has her own strange and fascinating encounters, though none are as grotesque as her brother’s.

This was an incredible read. Any Cormac McCarthy fan needs to pick up *Outer Dark*. Being one of his earlier works, it’s not as widely discussed as some of his other novels, but it deserves to be. It’s right up there with the rest of his literature in my opinion. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend *Outer Dark* as a starting point for McCarthy newcomers, but for fans, it’s an absolute must-read.",Sudden-Database6968,1h3gwu8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,2024-11-30 16:59:00,110,0.7,110,0,68,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3gwu8

books,Bent right to your wind sounds like a promising upcoming novel : Academic rivals to friends to lovers to marriage in crisis. ,"Has anyone else seen the promotion of this book on Instagram ? I feel like it sounds slightly unique or maybe i just like how the MMC and FMC look in the cover. It reminds me of Anne and Gilbert from Anne of green gables who were also academic rivals that eventually got married.

I always find it interesting how some books have kind of a combination between enemies and friends to lovers. Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter and Gilbert and Anne from Anne of Green gables would these be classified as friends to lovers or enemies to lovers? Ron and Hermione were clearly both friends and rivals at the same time whereas I suppose Gilbert and Anne went from rivals to friends to lovers. Except when they were rivals, it was more from Anne's side than Gilbert. The thing i slightly disliked about Anne and Gilbert is that Gilbert became a doctor and Anne didn't do much with her career. But in another way, I actually like that the author did that because it is realistic - sometimes you do well in school, you basically peak in school but don't do well after that. If it was me, I may not have wanted to get with my ex academic rival because i d feel bad that he did well for himself and I didn't. What about you guys ?

I think Bent right to your wind is very slightly different in the sense that we get to see what its like after the couple get married and see them possibly grow back together.

I just don't like the title of the book, it doesn't sound very romantic because it is like 'pass wind'. Maybe a better title could have been Bent right to your Aura/soul.

This is the blub for anyone interested : *Aaron Willow and Maya Amery’s story began with a book in a park, a budding friendship between a golden-hearted boy and a jaded, independent girl. But what started as an innocent connection soon turned into something deeper—and more complicated—when a betrayal disrupted their lives. Setting them on a path of academic competition, with each pushing the other to their limits while keeping buried feelings at bay.*

*Years later, Aaron and Maya are married, but the love that once bound them is now strained under the weight of the past. Nearly a decade into marriage, they’re confronted by a painful reminder of that old betrayal—a wound neither of them caused, yet one that reshaped their lives and relationship forever.*

*As the story unfolds through dual timelines, we see Aaron and Maya’s journey from friends to rivals to lovers, and finally, to a couple fighting for their love against the scars of the past.*

*Can they rediscover the magic they once shared, or will the shadows of yesterday prove too strong to overcome?*

***A tale of love, rivalry, and resilience, where each chapter alternates between the innocence of youth and the trials of a marriage in peril.***",AltruisticAide9776,1h43qmv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h43qmv/bent_right_to_your_wind_sounds_like_a_promising/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h43qmv/bent_right_to_your_wind_sounds_like_a_promising/,2024-12-01 13:53:29,0,0.24,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h43qmv

books,The Tearsmith (SPOILERS),"Ok, so I’m not usually a romance reader. However, I’m sometimes known for picking up a romance or two when I want something different for a bit. Which is how I came to read the Tearsmith by Erin Doom. 

Now, I don’t know if any of you have read this, but I can’t express how bad I found this book. I was a little intrigued by the premise, but my god was this book boring. The main characters grow up in an abusive orphanage together, something that colors literally all of their actions/interactions with each other, but we barely get to see what actually happened there. Instead, we get nearly 600 pages of, well, nothing. The chapters are incredibly repetitive, and drag on and on for no reason. The narration, which is usually in first-person, is pretentious and, again, repetitive. I want to excuse some of this, because I assume the translation from Italian to English was not perfect, but that does not excuse the way the main character is only able to talk in metaphors, and constantly talks about the same thing over and over again.

And the characters. My god. The main character, Nica, is written as “frail, delicate, and innocent.” And these are words that are actually used to describe her in the book. Actually, she’s written more like a 6-year old child. She’s obsessed with Rigel, the orphan she grew up with, and is constantly staring at him and thinking about how gorgeous and “dark” he is, and compares him to a wolf about 70 times. She’s clearly meant to be “not like other girls,” but she just comes off as an idiot. And Rigel. Jesus. He’s supposed to be the dark and tortured love interest, but in reality he’s a huge bully and can’t handle Nica touching him or he’ll “lose control” and ravish her against a wall or whatever. And every time he commands her to stay away, he gets as close to her as humanly possible and she trembles and shakes and can’t breathe. He also tries to “protect” her for all the guys who fall in love with her due to her “unique” eyes, something that is repeated over and over again. And she’s too naive to know that all these guys are disgusting and want to take advantage of her. 

Also, the book should have ended at least 6 chapters before it actually did. The author just kept adding more and more for no reason. The first couple of times I was like “ok, I guess she could add something else,” and then I just ended up skimming the last couple of chapters because they were so useless. If Nica had stopped waxing poetic over how dark and tortured and wolf-life Rigel was, the book would have been half its size. 

Has anyone else read this? Am I just being overly judgmental?
