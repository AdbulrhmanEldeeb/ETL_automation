webdev,How to have sub pages with unique URLs on my site?,"Sorry I'm not sure how to explain this in the title! I built my own site in Wordpress, but I'm a bit of a noob. I do quite a lot of different jobs - videography, editing, composition, sound design etc. I've had it all on one site, but I've had some people tell me they think I should have a separate site for Music and Sound Design as Agencies want a specialist, not someone who does everything, which makes sense

So I currently have my main .co.uk site and I have .com with the same name redirecting to the .co.uk site.

Are my only options for doing the above to buy a new domain and create a new website, or to have a page on my current site that doesn't link back to the main site or have a menu, but then people could just change the URL to get to my main site if they noticed

Are there ways of doing this I'm missing, which don't involve buying new domains?

webdev,How I solved common Prisma ORM errors,"I have been using Prisma ORM for the last 2 years, and I have experience with troubleshooting different types of error.

In this post, I want to share it with you, so you don’t have to spend hours figuring out what I’ve already learned.

**Why Prisma?**

I have been using Prisma to interact with the database for all my SaaS products. So far, I’ve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let’s start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that’s not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don’t have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I’ve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn’t have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn’t want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

You can find the [documentation of Prisma at this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

As a side note, I’m not affiliated with Prisma in any way, I’m just a happy user of the product.

webdev,Advice needed: Looking for a Freelancer to Build an AI-Powered LL.M.-Matching Website – What Should I Look For?,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently planning a website that helps users find the perfect matching offer on my site. The idea is to provide general information on the landing page, and then users can input their preferences via an AI chatbot (the best example i can find is Fiverr Neo). Based on their answers, the bot will suggest matching offers from a database. The rest of the site will offer detailed information about the individual offers.

I've already set up a WordPress site on google cloud and have a rough idea of how this could work technically. Now, I’m looking to hire a freelancer to bring this project to life. Before I proceed, I need some advice as i have never worked with freelancer before.

What should I look for in a freelancer?

What skills should they have? (e.g., WordPress, Dialogflow/OpenAI API, database integration, UX/UI design)

Are there specific certifications or portfolios I should check?

Should I hire someone specialized in AI, or will a skilled web developer suffice?



Budget and Timeline:

What’s a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I’m open to better alternatives if suggested.

webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    └───src
        │   index.js
        │   index.js.map
        │
        └───functions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    │   tsconfig.base.json
    │   
    └───packages
        └───bTSOrdAddrsCreate
            │   _registerPaths.js
            │   _registerPaths.js.map        
            │   
            └───src
                └───functions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:** For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it’s missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:** I’m not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review—I wouldn't fully trust it—making things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:** The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don’t offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:** Easy code export, since everything’s already local.

**V0:** V0 feels like me—it gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It’s not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:** Claude’s UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn’t straightforward.

Overall, Claude’s consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It’s stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,1,0.54,1,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

Bonsai-CLI will streamline web development for agencies or solo developers. I think it will truly 10-100x my development speed, for websites or web apps.

Demo + live-stream: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM1V1IjR96E&amp;ab\_channel=JackalopeLabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM1V1IjR96E&amp;ab_channel=JackalopeLabs)

Bonsai-CLI allows you to generate a beautiful web app in seconds, using pre-built and designed Tailwind/Alpine components. All the copy, images, layouts, components, templates, styles can be configured by AI in a matter of seconds.

It’s built specifically for Roots WP stack at the moment, in the future it could support more stacks.

Once you have a [Roots.io](http://Roots.io) site up running, you can run two commands to create a new landing page–

`wp acorn bonsai:init`

`wp acorn bonsai:generate bonsai`

At the moment, the landing page is fairly basic. I’m going to add all of my custom built components to it. Once Bonsai-CLI is done, it’s going to be able to build full on web apps in a matter of seconds. That’s the goal.

2. I listed things like setting up VPS and NginX, does that have any influence for a frontend position?
3. Since ChatGPT was used, is it obvious for a native? Would you change wordings?
4. I finished CS50x course by Harvard a year ago and I have their free certificate, does it count as a proper education and will it be best to include it in this CV?
5. Skills section, some of the things look funny to me, should I keep simple things like CSS and HTML in it or remove them, anything big missing?

They act as notification channels (like emails)—which is helpful for many teams—but they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers’ comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.
* **Escalate notification**: The bot can be configured to notify a manager if a PR sits for too long without reviews.

webdev,iOS Safari theme-color behaviour,"Recently, I was building a form for my agency’s website and decided to add a top bar and link to it. Once everything was done, I noticed on my iPhone that the theme color automatically matched the red of the top bar. I immediately thought, “Alright, let’s add some meta tags to specify the theme color.” I included tags for both dark and light color schemes, as well as a default one without any media query. Then, I added some JavaScript to ensure the theme color would dynamically switch between dark and light modes.

However, I noticed that if the theme color was set to pure white (#FFFFFF), Safari would still auto-adjust it to match the top bar’s color. I tried everything—media queries, adjusting the HTML structure, and other methods—but nothing worked. Safari just overrides white and picks the top bar’s color automatically. I inspected my website and confirmed the theme color was set to #FFFFFF, but Safari ignored it.

In the end, I changed the light mode color to #FEFEFE, which Safari respects, unlike pure white. It’s such a strange and unnecessary limitation. I had to make this adjustment because I didn’t want the site to look like you’re in a call when browsing the agency website.

So, I’m curious—how do you handle this issue? Do you even care about these kinds of details, or would you just leave it as it is?

webdev,Is it fine to find your own way of a ‘workaround’?,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing a next js website where it has some forms using shadcn/ui

So one of the form fields has countries list, which are over 170 elements in an array. While creating them with shadcn combobox or select, the website lags for a second because of the number of the html elements loaded for each country, but doesn’t lag on normal &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, however I need to have custom styling for it.

I did some research and came across something called virtualization with tanstack or react-window, but applying them threw many errors and it was just a headache

So what I did is, stored the array in a state with a slice(0,10) and once opened, I set the state to fill all of the countries.

Now this method works well, the combobox doesn’t lag, and everything is smooth, but is this fine to do?

I mean definitely there are better practices than what I did, but is this fine to continue with or should I reconsider my approach?

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I made a simple blindfold chess app,"Hi everyone, I'd like to share a side project I've been working on: [Blindfold Chess](http://playblindfoldchess.com).

**What is this app?**

It's a chess app that doesn't have a board! Play chess against the AI (driven by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)), but you must visualize the board in your head. The app provides menu-like inputs to select what pieces to move and where to move them, but it doesn't give any hints as to where the pieces are or what moves they can make. When the game's over, you can copy the moves to the clipboard and open them in an app that lets you visualize chess games.

**Why I made this app**

I learned how to play chess as a child, but I only started actually playing about two years ago. I studied a few openings back then and read two introductory books, but I've mainly just been playing casually. After a few months of playing, I challenged chat gpt to play a game of chess, and instead of showing a chessboard, it just said ""e4"". That was my first introduction to blindfold chess, and I found it highly challenging but not impossible to visualize the board, so I was interested in improving that skill. Unfortunately, chat gpt wasn't able to play coherent games and would inevitably begin making illegal moves as a game progresses.

I made my own chess AI a while back after and used that to play blindfold chess, but I've abandoned that project. Recently, after about a year or so since that last project, I began this. I'm a bit out of practice at the moment, but I expect that I'll improve over time so long as I play a game every day or so.

Surprisingly, I haven't found any apps that do what this does: provide a simple interface for playing blindfold chess. It's certainly niche, but I don't think it's so niche to the point that nobody would have made this simply for that reason. In any case, I'm curious to see if it actually gains adoption, or if I'm the only one who will actually use this on a regular basis.

**Future plans**

First and foremost, once the app has matured a bit, I'm going to make an Android app, then work to make an Android smartwatch app. I've done some preliminary performance tests and have determined that, if nothing else, a Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartwatch can handle the game in easy mode without taking too long to make moves.

After I improve my ability to play blindfold chess, I'd like to write up an article or two that discusses tactics and strategies to help you visualize the board. If there's interest, I might add a feature to play another human locally (i.e., you'd pass them the phone and they'd input their move). Technically, if two people are playing blindfold chess, they wouldn't need the phone at all, but if they disagree about where certain pieces are, the phone would provide an answer to that. I don't think I'll implement a capability to play online because of how easy it would be to cheat, but if people actually play on this app and request it, I'd consider adding it.

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release.

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like these.

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with.

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an everyday developer.

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team.

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer and starts a month later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that.

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches. 6 round loops. OA, code, system design, behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest.

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts rare and unique story showed me that a vast number of developers can likely excel in any position given the chance (even big tech).

I just wanted to say that you are good enough.

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine (As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.)

Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.",Invisible_Wetface,1h3deuo,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,2024-11-30 14:13:55,49,0.79,49,0,14,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3deuo

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started.

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

One simple way is ""Fetch data in layout, not in page at all"", but it is not a good practice. You should fetch data when you need it.

**Repost Story:**

Back in 2017, I was fresh out of highschool, not a dollar to my name. I had just signed up for the first semester of college as a CS student when disaster struck my family. Mom and dad both lost their jobs and became deathly sick to the point that they were unable to work. As a result, we became homeless and had to move in with some family friends.

I was working at a barista at Dunkin Doughnuts at the time, my day would consist of waking up at unglodly hours of the morning to catch the bus before the sun came up for my morning shift. After work I would study coding online and work on my college classes. 

One day I came home and got the call that my mom had been admitted to the hospital because she was minutes away from having a stroke and her lungs were filled with blood clots. I knew it was either make money or bust, so I started applying to hundreds of coding jobs while studying on sites like pluralsight to prepare. After hundreds of submissions, I finally got a callback for an interview.

I was nervous, stumbling my words, After an hour of coding, I got it to work. I went home, and recieved a callback the next day with an offer for the job.

There I was, a 19 year old homeless broke kid who had just landed his first real job in tech.

Since them I've mannaged to work for some big name companies like Hulu+, Disney, and Warner bros and launched a successful software business, I dropped out of college when I got the first job offer as a sophmore in college. I don't have a degree, or any special certifications, parents didn't give me any money.

I found that when I talk with people about my story in person they are very interested, so I figured I'd post online to see if my expereince can help anyone else learn from it so ask away.

webdev,"Is front end development dying [NOT duplicate, serious topic]","I'm sure there are lots of more exprienced developers out there, since I was professionally in the industry for 3 years now and I was working freelance before but things have gone much worse from my perspective. 

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice. 

it was like that in 2016 let's say...

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here’s the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we’re just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don’t just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here’s the explanation I got:

“If we ever need to change our server’s IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That’s impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.”

Okay, that makes sense, but using nameservers feels inefficient for so many other reasons... I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this problem without the extra workload.

I’d love to hear your thoughts considering my role at the company isn't as technical but this workflow is hugely affecting my output and I want to offer them a better solution.

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

webdev,CMS or VPS,"Hello everyone! 

2 years ago I made a small website for a charity, they told me it would need to be a static site which would \*not\* change over time. Well, so far there's been plenty of changes which also contain temporary changes (like an event).

Currently I have written a custom, ugly and bad static site generator, but it works in this case. The demand for changes has grown (still not a lot), and there's a request to move some of those responsibilities towards them, so they can maintain some of the content.

So far I've been looking into some CMS systems, and I haven't found a single one that I like. None of them offer the structure that I need/want for something small, or come off as having a snake in the grass on the free tier.

I've looked into Supabase as well, which I think I'd like, but it pauses your project quite fast, and freezes it after 90 days of inactivity. This doesn't suit me at all since it'll probably only be around 2-3 times a year they'll need to update their content. So the project would become frozen every time on the free tier.

I've also looked into Firebase, which looks like something I'd like to learn, but it doesn't offer image hosting on the free tier. And the Blaze plan looks good on paper, but I'm really afraid of having bots/abuse ramp up the requests/usage costs.

I've also looked at (not in detail yet) VPS. This is something that I'd love to learn, since I'll get full control over everything. My main issue with most systems is the control being limited. The main drawback here is, I'm terrified of unauthorized access, leaks, hidden costs, file uploads being abused and wrecking havoc... basically, a LOT of variables I'm not familiar with that could go wrong, I think... is a VPS really a safe option?

webdev,First-timer deployment strategy of web app,"Hi everyone,

I have been working on a new web app for the past few months, and I am approaching the moment of go-live. This being my first developed application, I am not sure what would be the best option for deploying. Digital ocean seems like an easy and straight forward option, but charging 15$/month for the db/cache container seems a bit steep.

For some context this is the technology stack i am using:

* Backend:
   * Spring Boot
   * Postgres
   * Mongo
* Frontend:
   * React

I am mostly oriented towards pricing, hosting platform quality, and future scenarios where I want to migrate. For example, I wish to have my app easily movable and not be locked in with a vendor.

I would highly appreciate and tips and/or tutorials for doing this so that I am ""covered"" when it comes to reliability and access.

webdev,Need help with scalability of app with dynamic data source,"I’m building a production dashboard where each part (e.g., bar chart) needs to fetch data from dynamic sources like SQL, APIs, and IoT devices. These sources are specified in a configuration file, and they can change over time. I need the app to handle these changes with minimal maintenance.

Here’s my current approach: I separate a quantity/time bar chart into two components: quantity and time. Each component is tied to its own plugin for different data sources (SQL, API, IoT). This results in more than six plugins just to update a single bar chart  because the data updates often require mixing and matching different data sources (e.g., SQL + IoT or API + SQL), i need to create additional plugin to handle new combination of data sources

As the number of plugins grows, it’s becoming harder to maintain. How can I improve this approach to make the system more scalable and easier to manage, while still allowing flexibility in changing and mixing data sources from the config file for each component?

webdev,Which CMS to use?,"Hi, I'm seeking advice on which CMS to use.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Background**


I am a content creator and have limited knowledge on HTML and CSS.


&amp;nbsp;
 

I currently have a website built by myself from scratch using Wordpress. I wish to use other CMS as Wordpress seems too cluttered and messy with so many 3rd-party plugins being installed. There is lack of cohesiveness in design and operations.


&amp;nbsp;
 

**Needs**


The website will be mainly an educational website with articles, videos and podcasts. Events will also be shown on the website for people to register.


&amp;nbsp;
 

Will be good if as many of the following items are built-in as possible instead of having to install plugin after plugin.


&amp;nbsp;
 

1) Native SEO


Don't want to wade through tons of SEO plugins, with each professing their way is the best way, just to get basic SEO done.


&amp;nbsp;
 

2) Forms


Built-in form functionality to collect feedback and to sign up for newsletters and memberships.


&amp;nbsp;
 

3) Memberships


I did not create memberships for the current website and would like to do so for the new website as I want to differentiate content between registered members and public.


&amp;nbsp;
 

4) Newsletters


For sending regular newsletters to members and people who sign up for them.


&amp;nbsp;
 

5) Integrations


Be able to integrate easily with other services like Nextcloud (for external storage, linking of videos, audio files &amp; images), Eventbrite (for booking of events created on Eventbrite) and social media platforms like Youtube, Instagram &amp; Tiktok (to showcase my videos and playlists posted on these platforms).


&amp;nbsp;
 

6) Localization


Able to have a multilingual website in English &amp; Chinese.


&amp;nbsp;
 

7) Mobile apps


Able to create mobile version of the website for Android &amp; iOS. Not going to do Native apps as they are too costly. So, I'm guessing I need to use headless CMS for this. However, I have read that Drupal can be Progressively Decoupled to allow for more Editoral needs and less Developer needs. Are there other CMS that can done this way? ([Source](https://medium.com/@opensenselabs/a-complete-guide-on-fully-decoupled-drupal-56fd283fcd60))



&amp;nbsp;
 

Any programming language is fine so long as the CMS can fulfill as many of the above items as possible.

webdev,A Browser-Based Solution for Reusable Libraries and Frameworks?,"Hey, I’m no expert, but I think I’ve stumbled on a genius idea:

What if browsers offered to store commonly used libraries and frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) locally instead of downloading them repeatedly for each website?

Here’s the idea:

* The browser could cache reusable libraries, especially popular ones like CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries.
* If a website uses modified or custom classes, the browser could detect this and ensure they aren't overridden. (web devs should notify the browser in headers or something to not override)
* For JavaScript, core functions of libraries could be stored in the browser, while any additional custom code gets bundled and served as usual. ( again, devs should notify the browser, and split their code too for this purpose)

This could save tons of bandwidth and improve loading speeds, with only small updates needed for library changes, and I believe that this is the future of web dev speed.

We already use **TailwindCSS** and **SCSS** in our development, so we're considering **shadcn** as a potential replacement. One key requirement is that the new library must be **heavily customizable** to help us maintain the look and feel of the Bootstrap components we're currently using.

We also need it to support:

* Accessible components
* Responsive design
* Vue3 compatibility
* Interactive Components (Modals, Dropdowns, etc.)
* Animations and Transitions
* Comprehensive Documentation and Active Community
* Potentially Dark Mode Support

Does anyone have experience using shadcn in a Vue3 + Tailwind environment? Are there other UI libraries or frameworks you'd recommend that offer a good balance between performance, customization, and accessibility?

I’m working on a unique, artistic project and want to build a super bare-bones website for it. Like, minimalist to the core. The simplicity is intentional and works for my brand. I’m not looking for anything polished or traditional.

Here’s the deal: I want to DIY this for full creative control, but I’m new to web dev. I’ve heard about decentralized hosting options like WTTP and love the idea of really owning my content. Is this practical for a beginner, or should I stick with something simpler for now?

I was thinking about getting a domain through Cloudflare but open to other ideas. Any advice on:
	•	Getting started with building something super simple like that.
	•	Whether WTTP or other decentralized options make sense here.

webdev,Question about GDPR and CCPA and cookie banners,"I'm making an startup that collects analytics and marketing data, [https://storyteller.so](https://storyteller.so)

The whole point of the app is to collect that data in-house, not using 3rd party tools or sending it to different providers.

From my understanding, the fact that the app is collecting information it requires to function, and isn't using 3rd party collection, it should be compliant to both laws without the need for a bunch of ""accept cookie"" banners.

It is also my understanding that sites that prompt those annoying cookie banners aren't really complying with the law.

I also don't understand the consequences of not following those laws if I'm not in  California or Europe, so I'd like to understand this and make sure I am compliant without doing needless feature work.



EDIT::: So I asked chatGPT but I dont knwo if I can trust it's answer, but it seems reasonable.

If your site and app use cookies **only for essential purposes**, such as maintaining user sessions and tracking which A/B testing version a user is seeing, and you gather analytics directly on your own backend without setting additional cookies for these purposes, your GDPR and CCPA obligations may differ:

# GDPR Considerations

1. **Essential Cookies**: Cookies used solely to maintain sessions and ensure functionality (like tracking A/B testing variations) are generally considered ""strictly necessary."" Under GDPR, **strictly necessary cookies do not require user consent**. However, users must still be informed about their use in a cookie policy or privacy policy.
2. **Analytics Without Cookies**: If you gather analytics server-side without setting additional cookies, this avoids the need for consent typically associated with analytics cookies. However, GDPR still requires you to:
   * Be transparent about data collection (e.g., in your privacy policy).
   * Justify the data processing under a lawful basis such as **legitimate interest**.
   * Minimize data collection to what is necessary for your stated purpose.
3. **A/B Testing**: Tracking A/B testing versions via session cookies can qualify as strictly necessary if it is essential for delivering the service users expect (e.g., ensuring they see a consistent version of your site during a visit).

# CCPA Considerations

1. **Session Cookies and Analytics**: Under CCPA, session cookies used for functionality or analytics collected directly by you (not involving third-party tools) are typically not considered a sale of data. However, you must:
   * Disclose that you collect analytics data in your privacy policy.
   * Provide a mechanism for users to opt out of data collection if the data is considered personal information.
2. **A/B Testing**: Similar to GDPR, if the data collected is necessary for providing the service (e.g., ensuring users experience the same A/B testing variant), it is unlikely to trigger additional obligations. Still, you should disclose it transparently.

# Do You Need a Cookie Banner?

* **No Cookie Banner Required**: If the cookies used are strictly necessary, and no analytics or tracking cookies are set, a cookie banner is not required under GDPR.
* **Transparency Required**: Both GDPR and CCPA require you to explain in your privacy policy:
   * The types of data collected (e.g., analytics data, session tracking).
   * The purposes for which the data is processed.
   * Users' rights (e.g., access, deletion, or opting out under CCPA).

# Key Steps to Ensure Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state:
   * What data is collected (e.g., session cookies, analytics data).
   * Why it is collected and how it is used (e.g., A/B testing, site functionality).
   * User rights (opt-out under CCPA, access, or deletion).
2. **Avoid Non-Essential Cookies**: If you don’t use cookies for analytics or third-party tracking, this simplifies compliance significantly.
3. **Lawful Basis**: For GDPR, rely on a lawful basis like legitimate interest for server-side analytics and strictly necessary cookies.

By sticking to these practices, you avoid the need for a cookie banner while still meeting the transparency and accountability obligations under GDPR and CCPA.",IAmRules,1h21jfl,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h21jfl/question_about_gdpr_and_ccpa_and_cookie_banners/,2024-11-28 17:49:14,0,0.44,0,0,57,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h21jfl

webdev,Why would somebody need a website when they can sell directly in social platforms?,"I'm kinda having hard time figuring it out exactly why somebody would need a website nowadays? Usually the website provides - 

- Brand image
- Product and business information
- Buying option

Nowadays, you can create videos about all of the information and can sell your stuff in social platforms. In my country, a huge number of businesses are operating through facebook ads and selling their products in DM's. 

They don't need a website for marketing, ads and videos does that it tiktok/fb/youtube. They don't need a site to sell, customers could talk to them via chat and order directly.

So your marketing effort does everything about building your brand image and awareness. You don't need a site to present your business informations. And you can sell through chat.

So it's making website unnecessary.

I'm not understanding the terms of service - theres is similar to Google (one of their named competitors). It says you can't pre-fetch, cache or store autocomplete addresses beyond 30 days. Does that apply to validated addresses as well?

How would a company, after a transaction (assuming that is the point of the 30 days), handle providing receipts to the end user beyond 30 days? I would assume an end user would still want to be able to verify what address a product was sent to beyond that time frame and a company probably would want to store that address longer to deal with incorrect sending/re-sending reppacements/etc. so how do they accomplish this?

Or are the storage terms there to prevent people from requesting all addresses in the platform and storing a copy of them all indefinitely (alleviating the need to use the platform) - more of a gotcha if needed?

I want to use this platform, it's the cheapest/least resteictive by far compared to Smarty, Loquate, Google (attribution), geoapify, USPS (mailing requirement) etc. but my address validation needs require storing the addresses a bit longer than 30 days (not indefinitely).",Unhappy_Trout,1h1vkzq,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h1vkzq/address_validation_radarcom/,2024-11-28 13:08:11,1,1.0,1,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h1vkzq

The backend is on Railway, the database is on Firebase, and I’m considering moving to DigitalOcean for better scalability and cost control. Before making that move, I’d like advice on:

How to optimise database reads for a roster app.

webdev,Bad Experience with a Client,"Initially, the client asked us to design a Figma prototype and then develop the website. It started off great and just needed some feedback.

We asked the client for feedback, and they sent us another Figma design with suggested improvements. However, this new Figma file was completely chaotic abd the designs were fully changed. It had a gradient background that didn’t match the sections, uneven font sizes across the sections, and bold fonts everywhere.

I immediately lost the motivation to code it again. Still, I coded it with some minor improvements (not noticeable at first glance). Then the client insisted that they wanted it *exactly* like the new Figma design. I did that too, but replicating it was nearly impossible because of how poorly structured the Figma file was. Despite this, I managed to pixel-match it to the best of my ability.

After all that, the client said, “I don’t like it.”

TIA.

Edit:
I've been building websites mainly for a major public institution. Most of my experience is with php and JavaScript, and I've dabbled with many other languages and techniques. 

To clarify: I'm not coding WordPress (yet if ever). I'm just managing the site. Most of the tutorials I've come across are aimed at folks with no web experience at all, and I'm a bit underwhelmed. 

EDIT 2:
Wow, thanks everyone! There's some sound advice and useful wisdom here. I really appreciate your thoughtful and useful responses.

And thanks to everyone who validated that it's possible to have deep experience in the field and not having experience with one of the gazzillion tools and techniques that are out there.

As an aside: a few years after I got into this field, the browser wars happened. Things got really messy for awhile. We had to deal with variations in browsers that were pretty confusing. New tools were rising that were helpful. But it was a hard time to know whether any path was a good one. I assumed things would get simpler with time. But they didn't. Web development is much more complex now than ever. Not so much in terms of code, but in the vast array of tools, options, techniques, vendors and so on. It's an exciting time, but also one of peril and pressure. Burnout is real. It has specific symptoms. Take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourself. Get some rest. Hang in there.

Thanks again for your help, I appreciate it.

webdev,Misleading salary offers in job opportunities,"I've been looking for a new job for the past month. I finally found the perfect match, but on the way there, I couldn't help but notice something that is increasingly used by firms/recruiters: huge salary offers, that lead nowhere.

A bit of context: I'm currently applying as a lead Dev in France/Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I saw a job offer in Paris, for an American company.

Remote 1 day/week. Fine by me, I like being onsite.

Salary ? 72k to 150k, based on experience.

Their stack is interesting, the product looks nice, I give it a go. 

It's a five step process, with 3 interviews, a peer coding session, and at-home assignment that took me roughly 5 hours. Last Friday, they came back to me: they want me on the team. So, 4th interview with my future manager and HR. Manager tells me that I aced the tests, and they'd like to start ASAP. 

Their offer ? 75K.

This is not the first time I see this kind of behaviour, so I asked frankly: I aced all tests, and showed interest in your product, and had a great human fit with everyone I talked to. We share the same values when it comes to both human and professional responsibilities. So, how comes I'm not getting the 150k salary ?

To which they answered that ""This salary is only for applicants who live in the bay area, since the cost of living is way higher there"". So, I turned down the job, because the offer they gave me was lower than my current salary. Plus, I felt like after showing so much investment in their process, this was basically a huge red flag.

Has anyone ever faced this ?

What am I missing?

webdev,Advice needed. Am I doing the right thing to switch to Dev?,"Hi everyone. 
I’m in need for some advice.
I’ve been working as a DevOps Engineer for about 5 years now. I’ve done system analysis for another 5 before that.
The reason why I moved on to DevOps was because I was given false hope and fell for the commercial of my employer. I was on my way to moving from Sys Analysis to Android Development because that was what I studied for. I was told by my current employer that I will be able to do development and will be able to sit with the developers and learn from them for experience but will work in DevOps. It’s been 5 years and I’ve never even met any of the developers face to face and only work with them if it’s Ops related. I want to get back into Developing but it’s been so long. I’m currently learning Kotlin but, I’m also 30 now and not sure if it’s worth it, or maybe just very despondent.
Any advice please?",NurieD,1h11xf7,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h11xf7/advice_needed_am_i_doing_the_right_thing_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h11xf7/advice_needed_am_i_doing_the_right_thing_to/,2024-11-27 11:11:04,2,0.67,2,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h11xf7

webdev,How to Handle Currency Conversion and Rounding Issues on a Global Platform?,"`To Be fair i am not a native English speaker so took some help from chat gpt for rewirting my problem to make it less painfull for you guys to read. my apologies` 

  
Hi everyone,

I’m working on a platform where service providers can list their offerings, and users from around the world can book them. We support multiple currencies, but our backend stores everything in USD for consistency. I’m facing a few challenges with pricing, conversion, and rounding, and I’m curious how others handle similar issues.

Here’s the setup:

1. A service provider creates a package with an hourly rate in their local currency (e.g., 100 GBP).
2. The backend converts the price to USD using the current exchange rate (e.g., 100 GBP → 124.56 USD).
3. Users see the price in their local currency, rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 125 USD).

Now the issues:

1. **Rounding Discrepancies**:
   * If the user books a package for 3 hours, they see `125 * 3 = 375 USD`. But the backend calculates `124.56 * 3 = 373.68 USD`. This mismatch confuses users.
   * If I always round on the frontend, the service provider might receive less than they expected.
2. **Currency Volatility**:
   * Exchange rates change over time. Locking the rate at the time of booking solves this for transactions, but I’m unsure how to handle edge cases, like refunds after months of exchange rate changes.
3. **Adding New Currencies**:
   * Storing prices in every currency a user might use isn’t scalable. If we add a new currency later, recalculating and storing all previous package prices in the new currency seems impractical.

**Questions for the Community**:

1. How do platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr handle pricing and rounding across currencies?
2. Is there a better way to deal with rounding discrepancies without overpaying/underpaying either party?
3. Are there efficient ways to handle refunds in multi-currency setups when exchange rates fluctuate?
4. Any scalable strategies for introducing new currencies without recalculating older data?

Would love to hear how you’ve tackled similar issues or any creative ideas you might have!

Thanks in advance! 😊",Aware-Silver-2221,1h101lb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h101lb/how_to_handle_currency_conversion_and_rounding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h101lb/how_to_handle_currency_conversion_and_rounding/,2024-11-27 08:52:50,2,1.0,2,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h101lb

Building forms is a repetitive task, time-consuming, and quite complex to get it right. Due to the Shadcn components, Zod, and other open-source libs, I could build a tool for building forms quickly and easily. You will use a user interface to define the forms' data &amp; attributes then the code will be auto-generated for you including Zod schema and shadcn components. Feel free to try it out.

webdev,"Quit to build WebDev freelancing, where is my actual value?","Apologies if you see my rant in different subreddits, I’ve cross checked and ensured that my post obey’s all guidelines. 

I’ll preface by saying I like to think I’m realistic not optimistic nor pessimistic and not coming on here to say some bs like time to make $5k a week off converting a client.



**Background:** 

(Pre) Background Summary: Boss made a comment so vulgar about my personal life I quit on the spot. Time to take a risk. 



Been scheming on starting freelance Web Design for 6 months now learning the ins and outs of Elementor and overall web design. Had a rude awakening realising that I’m essentially making life 6x as hard for me as I look now and my websites are Webflow websites created in Elementor when it comes to animation and overall feeling. Been researching and seems smart enough to switch over to Webflow and learning curve should be doable as I’ll be rebuilding a portfolio and own website in Webflow and taking Christmas period whilst businesses sleep to understand everything about where I need to be. Decided I don’t think I’ll be touching E-Commerce clients as that’s asking for trouble and in terms of restrictions for what I can provide with websites. Nothing with user accounts/logins and essentially just have a CTA and booking components. 



**Problem:** 

A pretty website doesn’t sell… I wouldn’t consider this endeavour if I didn’t currently work in corporate sales handling anywhere from $2000 to $50,000 deals from straight cold calling. My point is I understand you’re never in the business of selling a product to a company, you’re selling a tool that provides value and generates them new revenue.

So whether I like it or not I’m essentially selling a form of marketing. At the end of the day my passion is web design and I want to keep as close to that as possible as I can without locking myself out of the profit party filled with web designers that sell a website as part of a digital marketing package. 

I understand Webflow has SEO embedded but I can already see the clients face when they’ve heard SEO SEO SEO SEO SEO a dozen times and that is my only bullet for how investing in me building them a new website generates them more revenue. 



**Question:** 

My question is what angle for SMBs should I take to ensure I can confidently say they’re investment is going to pay itself off that isn’t shying too far away from designing on Webflow and entering the ‘aLL iN OnE DiGiTaL MaRkEtiNg sPeCiAl’ where I’m handling their google and meta ads etc. Just super intrigued as to how delusional I’m being or if there are people converting half decent clients essentially off straight web design as I more than understand the $500-1000 website motto is asking for trouble and headaches from cheapskate customers. 



Greatly appreciate any advice as I am as far as I can get in terms of throwing myself into the deep end and have no option but to go out and go get it. ",maxo6k,1h0yyro,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h0yyro/quit_to_build_webdev_freelancing_where_is_my/,2024-11-27 07:32:36,9,0.65,9,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h0yyro

webdev,SmarterASP.NET for Hosting a Low-Traffic Web App?,"I've developed a web app (currently running only on my PC) with the following stack.

Frontend: Angular (TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
Backend: ASP.NET Core (.NET 8.0) in C#
Database: Any database that supports SQL and stored procedures (or equivalent)

With many years of desktop application development, this is my first time working with web development and specifically ==&gt; deploying a web app. I'm unfamiliar with the process and which hosting services are the most reliable.

I'm trying to figure out the most practical hosting for a 'low-traffic app'. 

Microsoft's Azure hosting seems powerful, but its pricing is high and confusing.

SmarterASP.NET, on the other hand, has incredibly simple pricing plans-so simple they seem almost too good to be true. My main question is: Is SmarterASP.NET a good choice?

webdev,Is there a catch here? Why choose DigitalOcean when Hosting*r offers so much more?,"I’ve been comparing hosting options for the early stages of a social network project. I came across two options that seem wildly different in terms of the resources they offer:

|**Specification**|**DigitalOcean Basic (2 vCPUs, 2GB)**|Hosting\*r KVM8 (8 vCPUs, 32GB)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**vCPUs**|2|8|
|**RAM**|2 GB|32 GB|
|**Disk Space**|60 GB SSD|400 GB NVMe SSD|
|**Bandwidth**|3 TB/month|32 TB/month|
|**Cost**|$18/month|$20/month|

The resources offered by Hosting&amp;r are so much higher that it seems too good to be true. I get that there’s likely a difference in quality. For example, even if Hosting&amp;r’s 32GB RAM doesn’t reach its full capacity and performs more like 10GB in real-world scenarios, it’s still 5x the RAM DigitalOcean provides. The bandwidth difference is also insane - 32TB vs. just 3TB.

Given that I’m building a social network in its early stages with about 100 users initially, is there a major reason to stick with DigitalOcean? Are there hidden trade-offs in Hosting&amp;r’s offering that I might be overlooking? Or does the sheer quantity of resources compensate for any quality differences?

Which would you recommend for a low-traffic start, with scalability in mind?

webdev,"A question on canvas, bootstrap, and resizing","Hi all, I'm trying to make a page which loads an image into a canvas and then allows drawing on top of the image. The image itself is large, so I would like to be able to resize it by altering my window size.

Currently, the image is loaded into an &lt;img src&gt; and has Bootstrap's img-fluid class and that manages scaling nicely. However, I would like to add a canvas on top of the image to draw on it. If I change the &lt;img src&gt; to a &lt;canvas&gt; with the background specified as the image, I run into all sorts of problems. Either the image is tiny or the image is huge, depending on how I'm setting the background (use the style tag and the image is tiny, use javascript to perform a drawImage and it's huge), and in either case it does not scale with the page.

I am pretty stuck with Bootstrap but I'm not particularly stuck with canvas if there is a different or better way to do this. If anyone has any suggestions then please let me know.
