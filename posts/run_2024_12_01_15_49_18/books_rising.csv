books,Why Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy is a deeply unsettling work of fiction,"This book is wild. Just reading the back cover, I knew I was in for something crazy, but *Outer Dark* surpassed even my wildest expectations.

*Outer Dark* back cover:

*""A woman bears her brother's child, a boy; he leaves the baby in the woods and tells her he died of natural causes. Discovering her brother's lie, she sets forth alone to find her son. Both brother and sister wander separately through a countryside being scourged by three terrifying and elusive strangers, headlong toward an eerie, apocalyptic resolution.""*

This is an extremely dark read, but I loved every word McCarthy wrote. It was fantastic.

As I mentioned in my review of All the Pretty Horses, Cormac McCarthy is probably my favourite author. *Outer Dark* continues to reinforce that belief.

Interestingly, as I started reading *Outer Dark*, a Vanity Fair article surfaced claiming that Cormac McCarthy had a 16-year-old muse late in his life. While I haven’t been able to access the full article due to subscription barriers, the excerpts and discussions I’ve encountered paint the piece as overly stylized, almost as if the author is attempting to mimic McCarthy’s own prose. This stylistic choice, combined with the extraordinary claims made, makes the story feel exaggerated, if not dubious. I’m not dismissing the possibility that some of it might be true—if it is, it’s deeply troubling—but the lack of concrete evidence and the outlandish nature of certain allegations leave me skeptical. It’s also worth noting that McCarthy is no longer alive to respond or clarify these claims. While the article has sparked debates about separating art from the artist, I believe McCarthy’s literary contributions remain vital. His works deserve to be read and analyzed, even as we remain mindful of the complexities surrounding his personal life.

Now, back to *Outer Dark*.

This is an amazing piece of fiction. From the very beginning, the book is relentlessly dark. Set in Appalachia, McCarthy creates an eerie, almost fantastical world that feels alive in its desolation. The brother and sister live in an isolated shack deep in the woods, and when they venture out on their separate journeys, they encounter a cast of vivid and unforgettable characters. Some of these figures are helpful, while others are downright malevolent. These secondary characters breathe so much life—and death—into the story, amplifying its intensity.

The first time Culla Holme, the brother, meets the three elusive strangers face-to-face, right after his ride on the ferry, is one of the creepiest scenes I’ve ever read. The way McCarthy describes the shadows moving in the clearing and the strangers’ unsettling mannerisms—how they move, stare, laugh, and speak—is masterful. The tension is almost unbearable.

You know they’ll return, and when they do, McCarthy doesn’t disappoint.

*""Well, I see ye didn't have no trouble findin us.*  
*I wasn't huntin ye.*  
*You got here all right for somebody bound elsewhere.*  
*I wasn't bound nowheres. I just seen the fire.*  
*I like to keep a good fire. A man never knows what all might chance along. Does he?*  
*No.*  
*No. Anything's liable to warsh up. From nowheres nowhere bound.*  
*Where are you bound? Holme said.*  
*I ain't, the man said. By nothin. He looked up at Holme. We ain't hard to find. Oncet you've found us.""*

This scene is haunting, and when the strangers appear again—with the one-eyed baby and the tinker in the tree—the atmosphere is downright terrifying. I’m not sure if *Outer Dark* is officially considered a horror novel, but it’s probably the scariest book I’ve ever read.

I’m not a big horror reader. People rave about Stephen King, but I haven’t been impressed. I’ve read *The Dead Zone* and *The Shining*, and neither really did it for me. I actually prefer Kubrick’s adaptation of *The Shining* because it improved on the source material in tone and execution. That said, I love Dan Simmons, I mostly know him as a science fiction author, however, I read Drood and loved it, though it wasn’t the horror elements that hooked me. If you have horror recommendations, I’d love to explore more.

But *Outer Dark*? It qualifies as horror in my book.

Religious themes also run deep in this story, coming to the forefront in the latter half. One of the most memorable scenes is when Holme meets the hog drovers. After one of their brothers dies and Holme gets blamed, a preacher shows up, declaring his guilt without any knowledge of the situation. The absurdity of this preacher, casually pronouncing judgment, is both comical and thought-provoking—a sharp critique of blind religious authority.

Rinthy Holme, Culla’s sister, has her own strange and fascinating encounters, though none are as grotesque as her brother’s.

This was an incredible read. Any Cormac McCarthy fan needs to pick up *Outer Dark*. Being one of his earlier works, it’s not as widely discussed as some of his other novels, but it deserves to be. It’s right up there with the rest of his literature in my opinion. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend *Outer Dark* as a starting point for McCarthy newcomers, but for fans, it’s an absolute must-read.",Sudden-Database6968,1h3gwu8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,2024-11-30 16:59:00,112,0.7,112,0,68,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3gwu8

books,Do you think understanding is necessary for enjoyment of literature?,"I have tried reading Ulysses but just can't get through it. Here's a paragraph from the second chapter.

&gt;It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Sainte Geneviève where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.

Some chapters get easier but then we're back to more literary experimentations and Joyce basically showing off his amazing knowledge of things.

I was having trouble and someone who said he was reading through the classics in his free time said just read through it. And that he had read Ulysses in just a week, which I found astonishing. Did  he read it carefully, I wondered? He said he didn't get a lot of stuff but it doesn't matter, he still enjoyed it.

Anyhow, I said I I can't read what I don't understand. like I first need to learn more about philosophy, history, religion, Ireland, etc. Or at least need to have a few books and webpages open to look up each reference Joyce makes (and he makes plenty). And that is assuming I can understand his stream-of-consciousness style which I often can't. So it will definitely take me way longer than a week or two.

Some other people also report difficulties with Joyce but also passages or books from other writers, like Faulkner, Woolf, Pynchon, and so on. Yet there are many people who would tell you they enjoyed the work and had no issues. Yet, when you ask them more questions, you realize they did not necessarily understand what they read.

So where do you stand? Do you think one should take the same approach to literature as we often do to poetry, to accept there will always remain some mystery and we will never know certain things for sure? And that perhaps we don't even need to know them. Or do you think that unless one really understands a book they are reading, they are not putting in the effort the type of book demands and perhaps they can't claim to have really read the book?
