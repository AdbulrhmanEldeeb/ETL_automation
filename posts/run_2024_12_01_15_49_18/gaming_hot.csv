I'm getting a new laptop so she is going to use my old one and try to find some new games she can play without getting sick.

What are some games that are good for people who get motion sickness? She likes RPGs, magic and fantasy, adventure games. Not much for shooters, racing, or sports games. She plays a bit of WoW, but I'd like to find some things that aren't subscription based since she refuses to pay for that. I have Game Pass, so that would be ideal, but going through Steam or GoG is fine too. Nothing super graphic intensive since she'll be playing on a 4 year old Alienware laptop with a RTX 2060.

gaming,"Are there any alternate online servers for Unreal Tournament 3, or a similar active game for multiplayer?  I know Xonotic exists, but it seems it's not very active","I used to like to play online multiplayer Unreal Tournament, with the last being Unreal Tournament 3.  There used to be a lot of great online game servers with different game types, and some with mods, and I used to play those quite a bit.  I always liked the game and the genre, but recently, I've tried playing and noticed the servers seem to be shut down.  And today I noticed I can't even log in anymore.  Indeed, it sounds like [Epic turned off online services for some games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-is-turning-off-online-services-and-servers-for-some-older-games), including Unreal Tournament 3.

I installed [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org) several years ago, as it's a similar 3D shooter game, but I've noticed it doesn't seem to be very active - Whenever I go into multiplayer with Xonotic, there are few games, and what games there are usually only have 1 or 2 players.

I have to think people still enjoy playing multiplayer 3D shooters online?  Or have most people stopped playing them?  I'm curious if there are any similar active multiplayer games?

gaming,Buying games on PS5 Pro vs Series X?,"So, one of the main difference of this generation (PS5 Pro apart) was the PS5 controller, and a few games use the specificities of its controller.

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

gaming,Horses no longer gallop in Red Dead Redemption 2,"
Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

Is there any solution to this?",riegspsych325,1h2xh6t,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h2xh6t/horses_no_longer_gallop_in_red_dead_redemption_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h2xh6t/horses_no_longer_gallop_in_red_dead_redemption_2/,2024-11-29 22:21:01,0,0.32,0,0,34,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h2xh6t

Recently I started noticing, how after playing games with immersive atmosphere, gameplay and story my mood and feel of life changes.

 Like Disco Elysium making me melancholic and introspecive, or Stalker still keeping me in the hopeless harsh atmosphere, or KCD and it's funny but brutal story of Henry plaguing my thoughts.

Games being the ultimate escapism allow us to live out different lives and stories, different world and morals and I really find that amazing .",ETkach,1h24ixe,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h24ixe/the_aftertaste_of_immersive_games/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h24ixe/the_aftertaste_of_immersive_games/,2024-11-28 20:06:22,12,0.59,12,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h24ixe

gaming,When was the last time a game made your jaw drop in awe?,"I had been running an older PC that was using a 3070ti but unfortunately, the computer had actually been dropped a few feet from my desk during one of my seizures. Still worked fortunately but it had like a weird effect on the graphic card, tried everything from disconnecting it from mobo and reconnecting it making sure it was synchronized correctly. With luck it kept working but when I would try to run games, especially games with more intense graphics you could really notice it so I wouldn't buy new games. Latest game I was playing was deadlock beta but you really noticed it even at the lowest of settings and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

Finally decided it was time to get a new computer so I built myself a new one and gifted it to myself as an early Christmas present (Dec 11) and got it up last week after building it myself. Currently running an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU, 4080 Super GPU, 64gb of memory.

The first game I bought and tried playing was Warhammer 40k Spacemarine 2 and immediately upon loading the initial load video, I was just in awe and my jaw dropped as I couldn't believe it. It felt like I was actually there and even more in-depth than ever before. Reminded me why I loved gaming on a computer so much and what it felt like when it was working in sync perfectly.

gaming,"Those who've replayed the Portal games, how different has your experience been?","I was just thinking about these games and how great they were. How the pure joy from playing it is going on this whole world of discovery. I think these games, especially the second, are the most incredible experiences I've had gaming, simply because I didn't know what the hell was going to be coming next and there was this thrilling sense of escape and exploration.

 Also, just the progression of Glados as a character and some of the hilarious things she said. Stephen Merchant in the second game, just amazing - and of course, JK Simmons was just so weird and delightful. 

The small little story element Easter eggs, like the secret room with writing scrawled across the wall saying, 'There's no cake!' (or similar).

The amazing songs at the end. The euphoric feeling of listening to them. 


Anyway, I am getting the itch to play through again from the beginning. How different has your experience been revisiting them?

As they're puzzle games, they're obviously the sort of games you have to leave for a while.

The Witcher 3 inlcuding the dlc's for the first time in my life and what a journey it was.

Right now I'm finishing Hollow Knight and after that I'll start my 'winter game' and it will be either   
TLoZ: Wind Waker HD or Death Stranding.
