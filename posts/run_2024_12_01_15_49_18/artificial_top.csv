(this isn't official,but rather a WIP.)","This is a work i started. AI World basically is a Youtube inspired application. It has a site version and an application version. Inside AI World, there will be videos and shorts. The big difference is that AI World will be the only place where AI content will be uploaded. With the future of AI being uncertain, norms will of course be done, and so why AI World's concept exist. by the way, if you are interested,here is a link toward the document that describe AI World and its rules : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16z5QjnSnLoCW1\_M7MU6F6lUKyyr-M6aS?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16z5QjnSnLoCW1_M7MU6F6lUKyyr-M6aS?usp=drive_link)",Smooth_Solution_7075,1h44dv8,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1h44dv8/ai_world_the_future_site_where_all_kind_of_ai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1h44dv8/ai_world_the_future_site_where_all_kind_of_ai/,2024-12-01 14:26:20,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Project,self,t3_1h44dv8
artificial,What problems have you used to stump the top chat bots? They seem unable to solve this train riddle.,"Here is ChatGPT's second attempt, for example:

---

Step 1: Train A splits

1. Train A moves 40 cars and its locomotive into the siding, leaving the other 40 cars on the main track.

2. Train A's locomotive remains attached to the 40 cars in the siding.

---

Step 2: Train B moves

1. Train B (intact with all 80 cars) proceeds along the main track and passes the 40 cars of Train A still on the main track.

2. Train B stops beyond the siding, leaving space for Train A to maneuver.

---

Step 3: Train A’s siding cars return to the main track

1. Train A’s locomotive pulls its 40 cars out of the siding and rejoins them with its other 40 cars left on the main track.

---

Now both trains are on their way again, having successfully passed each other. This method uses the siding's limited capacity effectively.
