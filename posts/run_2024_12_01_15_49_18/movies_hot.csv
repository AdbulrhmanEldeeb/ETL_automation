He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. 

A few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  

* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. 
* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. 
* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. 
* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.

What are your Top 5 favourite movies of this year so far ?

Mine are                       -

1. Dune Part 2  - No doubt the greatest movie of the year and a perfect balance between  spectacle and detailed world building .


2. The Wild Robot   - Dramwork's best in years and one of the most hard hitting movies of the decade.



3. Kill     - An Indian movie which surpasses the level of modern Hollywood Action movies with ease imo . Non Stop insane ride of high octane realistic action sequences . ( Chad Stahelski is going to remake this movie in English )



4. The Substance    - The craziest a movie can get .



5. Smile 2      - A fresh engaging horror flick which lives up to the hype.

Bad Examples: I did not like 'The Boy and The Beast' because it starts out with the kid full of anger expressing how much he hates everything and everyone. Not something I'd want my kid to watch. Poupelle of Chimney Town starts off with a terribly loud and annoying musical scene.

Good Examples:

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

Long Way North

April and the Extraordinary World

Sirocco and the Kingdom of Winds

Kensuke's Kingdom

Big Fish and Begonia

Wolfwalkers

The Secret of Kells

Song of the Sea

My Father's Dragon

The Magician's Elephant

Eleanor's Secret

Sea Beast


These classic animated films:

Treasure Planet

Atlantis

Road to El Dorado

Titan A.E.

The Iron Giant

Prince of Egypt

Films like Encanto, Moana, Rayaa, etc. are all very good but are not exactly underrated films.

I've recently watched Django Unchained again and he was really briliant in it.

He was obviously also great in The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, Revolutionary Road, etc but those are his stand-out performances in my personal opinion

movies,The Girl Next Door (2004) deserves more love!,"Just finished rewatching The Girl Next Door and had to share why it’s so great:

Elisha Cuthbert absolutely shines in this role. Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she’s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. 

Timothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.

Also have to call out Elis best friend ""Matthew""... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next"" at the end

the movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.

movies,We Live In Time: making use of the lack of chronology for an alternate ending ,"[SPOILERS]

I feel like this movie missed a huge opportunity for a clever open ending that invites discussion.

At the very end, when Tobias and Elle are breaking the eggs on the kitchen, the camera films them from the side and leaves enough space behind the father to make the audience wonder if Almut is going to come in, but alas, she is gone.

I believe a more poignant ending would be to have her come in and hug him from behind, and then the movie cuts to credits, except: she has hair.

This would make for a perfect use of the movie's non-chronological storytelling, as we wouldn't be able to tell if she surived or if this scene is set in the past.",Arkanteseu,1h422q9,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h422q9/we_live_in_time_making_use_of_the_lack_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h422q9/we_live_in_time_making_use_of_the_lack_of/,2024-12-01 12:18:04,5,0.69,5,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h422q9

movies,cujo from cujo is a tragic villain.,"in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.

for starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.

things get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. ""it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.""

there's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!

even though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",herequeerandgreat,1h3ltsb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,2024-11-30 20:40:45,34,0.72,34,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ltsb

movies,After rewatching Inception my opinion on the ending has now changed forever,"I always believed that Leo was actually awake at the end. Nolan just showed us the spinning top as it was about to topple over before cutting to black and ending the movie. 

After rewatching the movie for who knows how many times I fully believe now that Leo is still dreaming. 

1. Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but…

2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven’t aged at all. 

Anyway that’s where I’m leaning now - he’s still dreaming. 

Edit: I’m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo’s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. 

I’ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. 

I will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I’m even more curious!

movies,Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo',"Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic ""stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen"" narrative. 

This is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. 

The film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. 

What I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.

The story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.

This is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate.

clive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.

grendel

john gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.

high and low

when it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.

the long walk

in addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.

the lost bus

""A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history."" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. 

eddington

ari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.

the battle of baktan cross

when it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.

wildwoods

wildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.

the phoenician scheme

leave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.

knives out and glass onion were both very well recieved murder mystery stories and fans have been eager to see what benoit blanc would get up to next. well, next year, we may have our answer. the next film in the beniot blanc film series is entitled wake up dead man a knives out mystery. rian johnson will once again serve as writer and director with daniel craig once again playing everyone's favorite southern detective. and like the other films in the series, there is a stacked supporting cast. josh o connor, glenn close, josh brolin, mila kunis, jeremy renner, kerry washington, andrew scott, cailee spaeny, daryl mccormick, and thomas haden church. while the plot is unknown at the moment, if the previous two movies are anything to go by, it will be a compelling mystery that will inherently need to be rewatched.",herequeerandgreat,1h3eqe9,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3eqe9/movies_of_2025_that_you_may_not_be_aware_are/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3eqe9/movies_of_2025_that_you_may_not_be_aware_are/,2024-11-30 15:19:29,34,0.63,34,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,News,self,t3_1h3eqe9

That’s the scene where he slowly describes to Leo’s character Amsterdam, basically, his life story. What he’s all about, how he’s managed to survive. 

Another scene like that is the famous Jaws scene with Robert Shaw where he talks about his encounter with sharks as a WW2 soldier after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk in shark-infested waters: 

https://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs

Another one of the most famous is Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, relaying his visions and experiences of horror in war - the disturbing aftermath after he and his group inoculate a village - and using that to justify and rationalize his own brutality:

I just watched it again and it was worth the time. Oldman and Kevin Bacon were both great, Bacon especially so. The movie is entertaining, but the acting is better than the script and the directing. The longer the movie goes on the more difficult it is to believe what you are seeing. Oldman struggles with his Boston accent a few times but overall he gives an above average performance in a movie I think you’ll enjoy.

Do you have any references I can use for these types of scenes?

* Their physical body (often monitored or observed by others)
* What they're experiencing in their mind

**The most basic example that comes to mind is** *The Matrix*: Neo fighting Agent Smith.

While he can't play the guitar in the traditional way, Johan has developed his own unique method of making music. For him, it’s not about perfection but about expressing himself and sharing his passion for sound in a way that’s entirely his own.

Johan also has a deep love for speed and the water. Though he needs assistance getting into a boat, once he’s seated, he takes full control. Steering the boat on his own, he experiences the thrill and freedom that come with gliding across the waves.
Beyond his personal hobbies, Johan has used his life experiences to inspire and connect with others. He’s authored several books that offer a glimpse into his world and the challenges he’s faced. Additionally, his online community of over 13,000 followers on Facebook has grown into a platform for encouragement, creativity, and resilience.

Johan’s story is proof that having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t push boundaries, inspire others, and live a life filled with purpose and joy.

Or the scene in Mad Max at 30:35 where he rises from the sand and scenes of orange and waves of almost fluid splash momentarily across the screen.

movies,What are your most unpopular hopes/predictions for Bond 26?,"For me, Bond 26 should be less like the Daniel Craig movies (even though I love his take on the character), and more like the Pierce Brosnan ones. Those movies I think found the groove between too serious and too campy. I'd love for the new Bond to be a little more fun. 

I'd also like to see Bond girls that James doesn't actually fall in love with. I didn't have a problem with this or anything in previous films, I just think it's been done to death with OHMSS, the Spy Who Loved Me, Casino Royale, Spectre and No Time to Die. 

Bringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Everyone else can be new, but I would like to keep Bond tradition of keeping the same supporting actors. If I could only keep ONE actor, I'd say Whishaw because I'd love to see him stick around for decades like Desmond Llewyn did.

But many of his films contain bizarre dialogue, and Blue Thunder might be the weirdest.  “I wouldn’t fly with Murphy for a bull that pissed Jack Daniels,” or “this baby fires four thousand rounds per minute, which is a shitstorm in anybody’s language.”  But the weirdest of all is when Captain Braddock (the great Warren Oates) calls Murphy back to duty and says they “just came up with a hot mince pie under each arm.”

Has any normal human ever spoken this line before?  What the Hell does it even mean?  I assume it’s bad, but I went so far as to look up the ingredients of mine pie – why mince?  Why is it hot?  Why under the armpits?

Which classic films would genuinely NOT benefit from a sequel, and WHY?   (Unless it’s obvious to all, might you tell us WHY you offer your answer?) 

These days, many (almost all) movies are made with a sequel or trilogy in mind. Even if the story ends with the destruction of the galaxy, there’s always room for that follow-up (and the potential for additional ca$h). 

In the past, movies were not created with this mindset.  Which movies are notably Not sequel ready?  In other words and in a roundabout way, how have sequels affected the quality of the movies being made today?

In my thinking, _Groundhog Day_ is a good example.  The story is completely wrapped up by the end.  No sequel necessary or wanted.

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Portugal - and as in the day before, I really have to say a big thank you to all the participants: We got more than 60 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. I'm also looking forward to another movie on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Capitão Falcão*** (engl.: *The Portuguese Falcon*) even have a fitting title in the english distribution. Never heard about it, but it seems to be a funny movie that also shows a little of the Portuguese culture.

Today, we skip Q in alphabetical order (no country starting with Q in Europe) and directly go to R... in this case, R like **Romania** for the start. As always, there are only two rules in the game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

The story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.

The Russians gave Häyhä the name ""White Death"" — and for good reason.

According to his personal notebook, Häyhä killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.

The movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.

Häyhä was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.

Due to his injuries, Häyhä was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.

Simo Häyhä was born in 1905 in Rautjärvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.

The film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about Häyhä.

movies,"I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ","I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. 

1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren’t even IN other movies. 

2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. 

3: If your movie isn’t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. 

Couple of facts: 

First movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube

Last movie: Planes trains and automobiles. 

Best movie: American Fiction 

Worst Movie: The Creeps.  

Movies I watched that I had seen before: 16

Most movies watched in a single day: 5


It’s been a long year and I’ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. 

Edit: sexually lol 

As requested Top 10: 

1: American Fiction

2: biosphere 

3: They Cloned Tyrone 

4: 1917

5: Maxxxine 

6: the Blackening

7: the vast of night 

8: The green knight 

9: bottoms 

10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)


Edit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? 

There are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). 

So allow me to clarify what in reverse:

3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don’t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the “movies should be as long as they need to tell the story” people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn’t be a need for an editor nor “directors cuts.” Some stories don’t need the time and some stories need more. 

2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don’t ever really see it on the screen.  

1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see “Justin Long” is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn’t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. 

If I learned anything real, it’s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it’s fun, then it didn’t waste my time. 

Glad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  

Glad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. 

I’m gonna go watch “It’s a wonderful knife” now.

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Poland - and I really would like to thank all the participants: We got around 50 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. Especially with this in mind, the final result is very close: ***Krótki film o zabijaniu*** (engl.: *A Short Film About Killing*) has won the race with just 12 upvotes (minus the given downvotes).

Today, I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in Portugal. As always, the winner  will soon take its place in [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And as always, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,How to approach Salò (1975)?,"I have a problem with Salò that I'm struggling with and I would appreciate some advice.

I am a divorced man in my middle age with a son of seventeen. He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.

With his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. 

He also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and ""some other films that are not as interesting"". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.

And I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.

Or should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later?

movies,A Different Take on The Notebook's Ending,"

Hi Everyone, 

I recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:

Instead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.

Years later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.

One day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.

Then, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.

But fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",Chahes03,1h3laak,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,2024-11-30 20:16:01,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h3laak

movies,"With today’s appetite for legacy sequels and expanded universes, a Seth Gecko film would resonate with both longtime fans and a new generation eager to see Rodriguez revisit his gritty, blood-soaked roots.","It’s a real shame that Robert Rodriguez has mostly shifted to making kid-friendly movies lately. While Spy Kids and We Can Be Heroes are fun in their own way, they don’t really tap into the raw, edgy filmmaking talent that made Rodriguez stand out in the first place. He built his career on gritty, intense films like Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, which pushed boundaries and brought something fresh to action and horror. A movie about Seth Gecko would be the perfect chance for him to return to those roots, creating a film that’s dark, thrilling, and full of that unique Rodriguez style that made his earlier work so unforgettable. It’s also undoubtedly George Clooney’s best work and he’s become so boring lately—a return to the character would be amazing .

movies,My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films,"It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.

Since that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I’ve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock’s films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!

Here’s a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn’t an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.

1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I’m not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.
2. Rebecca I’ve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I’m not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.
3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It’s been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.
4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they’ll be in the clear. It’s one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it’ll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.
5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn’t quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.

It would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.

If you haven’t seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won’t regret it.

movies,Best movies made from TV shows? ,"For example, The Simpson’s Movie from 
The Simpsons, or El Camino from
Breaking Bad. 

They’re my two personal favourites. While
El Camino was somewhat of a step down from Breaking Bad, it was still a pretty amazing movie, and could’ve been pretty successful as a stand-alone movie, the plot definitely would’ve worked. Was also just a beautiful conclusion to Jesse’s story. 

The Simpson’s Movie was probably my second favourite. The Simpsons is probably one of my favourite TV shows of all time, and my favourite cartoon/animation by far. The movie wasn’t much of a step down from the series and episodes themselves. It was just as funny as most episodes are, but had a lot more emotions in it. I also much preferred the animation style it had than what the series turned into a couple years later.

Even the silence in the movie felt tense, and the music made everything worse. What made it scarier was how real it felt—like this could happen to anyone. I couldn’t stop thinking about it afterward, and for days, I kept feeling like something was watching me from the shadows.

Me and my friends are embarking upon a long and very stupid journey to watch every single talking animal film (we will later also be creating a Tier List for them). In order to classify as a talking animal film it must meet these two criteria

1. the animal MUST talk (obviously) so human like animals such as snoopy are disqualified
2. the animal/animals MUST be one of the main protagonists (this leaves a movie like Shrek up to debate as he is a secondary protagonist, leaving open to discussion)

If we have somehow missed a movie (TV specials do not count) please comment and We will add it to the list, otherwise pray for our sanity. all we've seen so far is the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies and we already went slightly crazy

movies,Was Inception About Coping With Dementia and Grief? ,"Would love to get the community's perspective on a different angle on Inception. 

There was this recurring quote in the movie from both Cobb and Mal throughout the movie: 

""You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you when the train will take you, cuz you'll be together.""

What if the movie is really about a failed suicide pact and dementia? 

I think the whole sequence from 2:12:45 to 2:13:50 redefines the whole movie.  This is the final scene with Mal after the kick is underway where Cobb reminds Mal that they had already grown old together and we see older versions of them walking in a city holding hands (with wedding rings) and then seeing the hands clasped together and rumbling on what looks like train tracks (with wedding rings, but you have to zoom in).  We know from Nolan that any scenes with the wedding ring was real life.

Two big prevailing themes in the movie centers on ""an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone"" (2:16:03) and taking a leap of faith.   Perhaps old Mal had dementia (in the above sequence Cobb tells Mal that she doesn't remember) and perhaps they planned a suicide by train (old hands on the train tracks) and he couldn't take the leap of faith and left her on the tracks at the last second leaving Cobbs now an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone and the movie reflects his reconciliation and grief.   Perhaps the whole movie is a dream of old Cobb sedated while in hospice but that's just my speculation.  Mal kinda pokes at the fourth wall a bit in the sequence from 1:59:59 to 2:00:51 which highlights how everything in the plot had conveniently come together so nothing is real.

The movie shows the barbarity of the nazi regime, every single nazi in the movie is absolutely disgusting and inhumane, while practically every soviet is an everyday person doing what is necessary to survive. The movie at no point questions any soviet policy during the war, in the movie they are justified at every point, even the boy robbing the cow can be sympathized and understood easily.

And see, this is not a problem, we know the horrors of the nazi war machine, we know that 25million soviets died in WW2, they have every right to be pissed and to tell the story that way, which brings me to what I think is one of the main messages of the movie: **sometimes war can be justified.** The movie shows: ""the nazis are attacking us and it is either us or them"", what brought the end of the nazis? It was war, not pacifism or diplomacy, no, **war.** Particulary the USSR, we know they were the main protagonists in the defeat of the nazis, that's history, and the movie came out on the 40 year aniversary of the soviet victory. The movie ends with the soviets marching together towards nazi defeat. With the kid shooting Hitler's portrait. Even when they had the upper hand on the nazis they were pretty humane, considering the level of barbarity that was shown towards them throughout the movie, they quickly shot them and moved on, no sick games, no torture, etc. This is a very nationalistic and pro-soviet movie, and again this is not a moral judgement, this is not a flaw, it's just the story they chose to tell and it is a masterpiece.

I think a truly anti-war movie should portrait war as something pointless and unnecessary from the pov of the everyday man like in Grave of the Fireflies. The war reflects on the kids as something that only harms them, they have no reason to engage in it, they don't understand it, it happened for the political/economic interests of the japanese empire. We know from history that Japan was more in the wrong than not and they were the agressors most of the time, so the movie shows this nihilistic perspective in which the war serves only to cause suffering even to japanese citizens and the kids die for nothing, they are not remembered, what happened during the film is absolutely pointless, as was the war. Another alternative would be to make a pro-peace movie, I like a quote from Coppola about it:

&gt;*But an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like The Burmese Harp – something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness*

movies,"I know I'm about 17 years too late, but 28 weeks later was an absolute dumpster fire of a zombie film. (Rant) (Spoilers)","
Just to begin, I have had some heavy consideration after getting some comments that have changed my opinion about this movie.

This movie was not a “dumpster fire”. It was actually a pretty entertaining film that shows some new and also old ideas.

I now believe that this movie was just a little underwhelming, considering it was a sequel to a great movie like 28 days later. If it was a movie of its own, then it would be a solid B tier movie, but it just can’t really live up to how 28 days later made me feel personally.

And now, onto my heavily flawed rating on how this movie was.

&gt; Starting off, how was Don even allowed to enter his (ex) wife's holding area? (He left her to die so I consider that as divorce.)
I know he has the ""all entry"" key card because of his status, but she is of EXTREME importance and danger. She should've only been allowed to be seen by scientists or guards.

&gt; Speaking of guards, why was NOBODY guarding her?
She is possibly one of the LAST infected humans on Earth, and she is left by herself. As shown in the movie, she caused another outbreak, and I bet if there was ONE guard in the room with her, none of this would've happened.

&gt; Why would the producers kill her off right then and there?
She was killed MINUTES after she was rescued, and it would been a better choice to see her tell her children what Don had done to her, and THEN she dies.

&gt; How did she survive the attack in the safe house anyway?
They don't just leave you alone if you are infected, as shown by Don, he literally murders her ON THE SPOT after seeing her. So if she was bitten in the safe house, they surely would've mad sure she had turned.

&gt; They gave absolutely NO warnings about the flashing lights, I'm just lucky I'm not epileptic. Gave me a terrible headache after though.

&gt; Why would you direct a crowd of people into what would basically be a slaughterhouse, and the LOCK them in there with NO guards and NO lights?
Nobody protected them, the majority of them were infected within a matter of minutes, and then the guards outside were basically a firing squad.

&gt; Why didn't Scarlet just say ""These children could lead to a cure."" Or something instead of just stating her rank?
I'm pretty sure if I was a guard and I heard that, I would just let her through.

&gt; Why does NOBODY have proper protection against bites/blood sprays?
They have had this infection for a whole 7 MONTHS and not a single person has proper protection against bites. If a normal person was in a zombie apocalypse, they would at least wrap magazines around their arms or something to protect themselves.
If somebody had worn a riot suit/armored hazmat suit, they would probably survive an attack.

&gt; Why didn't they just burn the entirety of Britan/surrounding infected areas to begin with?
I'm pretty sure most life wouldn't survive being turned into ash, other than Dan somehow.

&gt; How did Dan even survive? I know we see him standing behind a building so he doesn't get charred, but there was fire coming from all directions.

&gt; I get it, nuking the city most likely wouldn't work, or would lead to Britan AND France/any surrounding countries being eradicated, but that's better than the possibility of that ENTIRE side of the globe being infected.

&gt; It has been less than a year, and people are already moving back into Britan. It hasn't even been full cleared yet, let alone the corpses even fully decomposing, and people are moving back in like it's nothing.

&gt; Why didn't Sergeant Doyle (Stupid haircut) tell General Stone (Helecopter man) that Andy (The literal only cure in existence) is able to stop all of this?
That would've stopped a lot of trouble.

&gt; Is it even possible to outrun a fireball??

&gt; How does one, nearly 180-200 lb man, make an entire helicopter go out of control just by grabbing the skids?

&gt; Furthermore, how did this idiot not get infected while all of those zombies were being blended into a person salad?
He was DRENCHED in blood head to toe, and it looked like he was still okay, but I may be wrong.

&gt; How did any of those infected survive being cut into peices? They can't survive a 5.56x45 round to the chest, but can be split in half and still try to crawl around? These are still humans we're talking about, even if they are infected. Humans usually don't survive being chopped in half.

&gt; If infected can be killed by gas, why didn't the military... I dunno... GAS THE ENTIRETY OF BRITAN FROM THE START? THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT MORE LIVES.
And yes, I know what wind does to gas, but it could help if they even tried from the beginning.

&gt; A thin shirt does not save you from poisonous gas, just look at the soldiers from WW1-WW2 and you could guess how that would go. (When they were gassed in the trenches they had special masks drenched in special chemicals to counteract the gasses effects, any who didn't put these on could be dead in minutes, or suffer severe respiratory damage.) So a shirt probably won't stop much.

&gt; Why would you burn a clearly UNINFECTED man to death? At least have the decency to shoot him to death, then burn him.

&gt; I kinda get the helicopter shooting at their car, with the ""Kill all on sight order"" and all, but I don't think any infected can drive a car.

&gt; Why would you SCREAM into a dark building? Scarlet got killed because she was yelling. (Idk why I put this here tbh.)

&gt; The trope of ""I'm gonna jumpscare you when you turn back instead of just killing you when you're not paying attention."" Is a little overused, but again, this movie came out in 2007.

&gt; It was terrifying seeing her be bashed to death with her own gun, but why haven't more infected done this sort of thing? That's showing higher brain function, and this could’ve been used more often. I guess Don being the only infected to use a weapon just adds to the shock value.

&gt; Why would Tammy just drop the gun after seeing her brother get bitten and therefore (presumably) infected?

&gt; Why would you leave your only form of defense? You don't know the next time you'll need a gun.

&gt; One does not just ""brush off"" being bitten in the throat, let alone a child. Like yeah, you can't turn into a zombie, but that doesn't mean you can't bleed out either.

This would’ve been better if it was not a sequel to such a great movie as its former.
In comparison, 28 days later was a much better movie imo, with much better storytelling and plot.

I rebuke the title calling it a “dumpster fire” and it was more of just a let down.

movies,What was going on in the Chinese movie industry in the early 80s?,"So I was looking at [this list of movies ordered by most box office admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_by_box_office_admissions) and I noticed all the top ones are Chinese. At first I figured ""big population, makes sense"" but then I noticed that they're *all* from 1979 to 1985. What's up with that? There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?

I tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.

movies,"Benji ""A Real Pain"" (2024) ","While seeing this film I noticed small bits of things I tend to do that correlated with Benji (Kieran Culkin's) behavior. Just like Benji I am very extroverted and a happy person in general, but there are moments when certain things or situations just get to me very deeply and I get very emotional. I'm hypersensitive which means I enjoy life to the fullest and is grateful for the little things in life but I can also get sad for the littlest things which makes me suffer unconditionally. I've never met or seen anyone like me until I saw this movie. I was evaluating every single person's reaction to Benji's way of being, non of them wanted to be near him since the risk of him having a tantrum or having an emotional burst...This made me realize why I don't have any close friends or people around me, seeing the movie made me realize that if I had a benji I wouldn't wanna be near him or myself with the fear that they could hurt me in emotional and mental ways; being there for those types of people is very draining. They tend to be very negative towards themselves and feel like they don't deserve certain things. These negative feelings toward themselves makes them jealous of everyone since they feel like they aren't capable of deserving true love and real happiness. I am writing this description based on the things I saw he does in the movie as well as what correlates with me. I've been reading reviews like crazy to find a diagnoses because he has the same issues as me. He was diagnosed with bipolar disease and took medications but I've been told I don't have bipolar and would never take meds to solve a mental or emotional issue. I've been in a personal journey to help myself since my mother told me she prefers to protect herself from me since it's very tiring to be near me. The good times are amazing but she says she senses evil and negativity just as if I wanted to ruin a good time and have everyone focus on myself. I struggle with self-destruction tendencies since I was a kid and a part of me  thinks I do this because I feel like I'm not good enough and all the overthinking gets together and makes me burst with emotions or doing something to hurt myself or others just so I could stay alone and suffer. I think benji and I just both struggle with self-destruction tendencies. My psychologist told me that my personal self-love journey is going to help a lot and I won't be able to let other people love me until I learn to love myself. Personally I'm very happy that I've become self aware of all the people i've hurt in my life but most importantly myself, I'm glad I finally made the choice to help myself and stop being the victim. I'm a bit nervous because I've never been to truly love myself even after 22 years, I've always been quite negative about my body and even if I fix something it's never good enough, I just need to love who I am and I'm sure I can get through it with the right professional help.",Intrepid_Computer_68,1h2tzux,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h2tzux/benji_a_real_pain_2024/,2024-11-29 19:41:26,0,0.38,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h2tzux

movies,Quotables,"Continuing a discussion from last night's Thanksgiving dinner, do you think movies have gone down in quality and quantity of Quotables?

I think the single most quotable film of all time is The Big Lebowski.  Pretty much every line in that film is God-Tier quotable.

Some films only have a few Quotables but they're just as epic. Aliens for example has ""they mostly come out at night"" and ""game over, man!"" which are both gold.

The great comedies are masterpieces of Quotables.  Airplane! and Hot Fuzz in particular (along with the already-mentioned Lebowski) are packed with incredibly awesome Quotables.

But what happened to cinema?  These days you barely even get a single great Quotable even in good movies.  I loved both the new Dune films, but I can't think of a single good quotable in either one.  ""I love you 3000"" is an ass-tier quotable.  ""On your left"" like that's not even fun, what else has Marvel even got?  ""I am Iron Man"" I guess but that movie is now 14 years old and the first one they made, and back when films still came with quotables.

I think we need to do something, write letters to the studios maybe or holler at James Gunn on twitterX.  Great one-liners are an important part of the moviegoing experience but nobody drops them anymore it seems.

movies,"Ben Stiller could be thought of as more of a great director than as a comedic actor, in ten years' time","So Ben Stiller, damn he can pull some moves behind the camera.

He's known more as a comedic actor - but I think in ten years, he could be thought of as more of a great director. 

I'm currently watching 2018 mini-series Escape of Dannemora, and it is HBO level good. Based on a true story of a prison break. Really gritty. Starring top actors giving some incredible performances, Benicio del Toro, Patricia Arquette and Paul Dano. The scenes are all so captivating. Just a really well put together show all round. 

Then of course, there's Severance. Just stupendous, a real fine wine of a tv show. Gloriously quirky and compelling. Great to see Adam Scott beng given something more meaty to work with. He's such a great straight comic actor that it makes perfect sense he could play such a nuanced, thoughtful character. Plus, it's just such a great ensemble drama. 

Stiller's projects seem to all have a real subtext, and you see that in most scenes.

My points on these shows is that Stiller clearly can unlock special abilities in his actors to really explore a scene, a feeling or a premise and give it so much more depth

These are all really interesting performances and fascinating projects. 

I think as long as Severance doesn't continue to take hellishly long and wraps up after an appropriate amount of seasons, Stiller could go on to make a few more really renowned dramatic films or tv shows.

Plus, he has an impressive back catalogue of directing credits on more comedic movies, dating back to the 90s. Including The Cable Guy, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. You don't make these great comedy movies without having incredible directing chops.

yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Norway. More than 24 hours and almost 100 comments later, we have a clear winner: ***Flåklypa Grand Prix*** (engl.: *Pinchcliffe Grand Prix*) will be a wonderful addition to our official Letterboxd list, which becomes more and more heterogeneous, as the time goes by. 

today, I ask you for your favorite movie set in the next european country by alphabetical order: We leave the letter N and go to P like **Poland**. It won't be quite as personal for me as Germany (where I was born and still live today), but both my parents come from Silesia, so I'm even more excited about your suggestions. All I ask is that you stick to the following two rules: 

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,Out of My Mind (2024),"I saw this movie being advertised on Disney+ today. It was brilliant despite being a teen/YA Disney movie. Which, even when I was a teen, I usually saw as mediocre at best. I really want to promote it in my own way as I doubt it'll get too much mainstream attention. 

While it'll never be on any lists of greatest movies or anything, well maybe on a list of ""best movies about a disability/disabled person"", but it more than succeeds at what it aims to achieve. I admit I watched it because of a personal connection, I have cerebral palsy, just like the main character, and have only seen one other film about my condition before *My Left Foot*. I was very happy to see that another film about my disability has been made, and with an actor that actually understands the condition fully too, that didn't just patronise and seek to show us as weak and pitiful. 

Anyway, the film was great. It succeeded in providing an insight into the condition from both the disabled individual's perspective as well as the carer's perspective. All of the actors were believable and elicited genuine reactions from me as the viewer. It reminded me of the discriminations I suffered at that age but also the times that I was lucky (and continue to be lucky) to have good people in my corner to support me. 

The greatest praise should be reserved for the lead actress, Phoebe-Rae Taylor, who is a genuinely great actor. Especially for a 12-13 year old making her acting debut, even though you could argue that she is playing a character that she has a unique insight about and wasn't always acting in the traditional sense, as she has cerebral palsy herself. She shines in this movie, showing the highs and lows of living with this disability, and reminding me of things (both positive and negative) that I hadn't thought of in years. It also reminded me that the frustrations I live with on a daily basis, and can feel immensely guilty for, are normal.

I really encourage everyone to watch this film. Even if you don't have a disability yourself, or have any connection to someone that does, it is a great movie. It will show you how, and how not to, act around someone that has a disability. Even I learned something, it highlighted to me the impact of my own ableism, (be it self-hatred and/or external reaction to those I perceive as ""more disabled""), that I have recognised before but not as obviously as I could while watching this film.

I hope that, if you are able to watch this film, you enjoy it. It is bittersweet, and the last half hour or so was genuinely heartbreaking to me, but it is an important film that I'm happy to have experienced.

movies,Good for Francis Ford Coppola,"Any director’s (potential) last film should be as challenging as Megalopolis. I think it’s gonna age well. Unlike what he almost left us with as his last flick, Twixt. A bizarre meditation on loss and love. Megalopolis is everything plus the kitchen sink. It’d  be one of those films that when it’s on TV I’d have to stop and watch it. For a director (and writer) in his mid-80s, Francis has accomplished something his contemporaries can’t. That’s continue to take big, experimental risks on himself and his films. He’s done what George Lucas always said he’d do, but hasn’t. I haven’t enjoyed a Spielberg film in decades. DePalma can’t seem to get it together (and I root for him).

movies,Recommendations for great uses of classical music in film?,"I posted something similar in the Classical music sub, and thoughts it might be interesting to see responses from here as well!

The context:

I'm totally new to classical music, but I've started compiling a bit of a playlist, and have found that I'm somehow really drawn to pieces that have been used to what feels like good effect in film / TV. There's something about how the music is connected to a storyline that makes it powerful for me, for example:

""Elizabeth"" (Elgar's Nimrod, Mozart's Requiem in D Minor)

""V for Vendetta"" (Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture)

""The King's Speech"" (Beethoven's Symphony #7)

""Wit"" (Arvo Part's Spiegel im Spiegel)

Is there anything that you might suggest I look into adding to this list? Something that you feel was employed really well in cinema?

(For what it's worth, I started looking into this after compiling a list of some scores composed specifically for film, by the likes of John Barry, Dario Marianelli, Howard Shore, Williams etc..).

Also, I think I initially got reeled in (ha, pardon the pun) after viewing this video essay on how Shore approached the Lord of The Rings score:

""How Music Elevates Story""

https://youtu.be/e7BkmF8CJpQ?si=eiYbn8O3Vc4dVZfD

movies,An Observation about the Sixth Sense 25 Years Later,"Yadda, yadda, spoilers.

When Sixth Sense was released it looked like a generic ghost story movie which I had no interest in until a friend, whose opinion I respected, told me I **had** to see it, but wouldn't tell me why. I would bet that a number of other people at that time had something like a similar experience; either they heard from a friend or read some reviews or just saw the box office numbers and realized this movie had something going for it. So I went with a few other friends and we were blown away by the ending, naturally. Recently, I remembered the conversation we had immediately following the movie and I recalled that all of us said the same thing: just before the ending, we thought it was a fine film, but didn't see what the big deal was –and *then* we saw the twist and were just as thrilled as everyone else.

And that recollection made me realize something either truly ingenious about Shyamalan or that he just got incredibly lucky. Take your pick.

That is: up until the end, it's not really that great of a film at all. I mean, it's fine. A few good jump scares, definitely some creepy scenes, but without *that* ending, the film is a C+ or maybe a B. However, preceding that awesome twist with a just an okay film completely misdirects the audience into thinking this is, in fact, just a mediocre picture. But then when the twist happens and we're all blown away. It's the basically the ""Yeah, I'm not doing anything; don't worry about it, everything is just normal"" misdirection that magicians use all the time and, like in a good magic ~~trick~~ illusion, lulling or even boring the audience into thinking they know what's going to happen is makes what actually does happen all the more amazing.

So maybe Shyamalan made what he thought would have been a great ghost story all along, but just got really, really lucky that he thought of a really great ending. Or maybe he intentionally kept the first half fairly low-key/stakes to stun us at the end.

movies,I liked Challengers much more than I expected ,"This was actually back in July. A friend recommended it, so I bought it on Prime.

I went into it completely blind, so I had no idea about the plot besides the fact that it involved a love triangle, so I expected some kind of shallow sexy drama.

I've never watched Euphoria and I had only seen Zendaya in Dune, and I wasn't impressed, but she's great in this. It's funny to see how she clearly doesn't love either of them, and is just in love with tennis.

I also loved **Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' electronic soundtrack** and how it highlights emotions and moments of tension, especially when the characters are fighting. But the thing I liked the most was the portrayal of the boys' friendship and overall rapport, which looks and sounds, for lack of a better word, real. Especially in the flashbacks from their teenage years the dialogue and the acting make their relationship sound very realistic.

I felt stupid at the end when the credits rolled out and it showed that Guadagnino was the director. Maybe it's because I was very busy this year, but I didn't know he had directed this (shameful for an Italian).

movies,Finally saw Requiem for a Dream...,"After seeing multiple posts and comments about how great the movie Requiem for a Dream is, I finally watched it today and...

IT WAS AMAZING!!! 10/10!

I wish I had seen it years ago and will definitely respond it to as many people as I can.

The entire film was captivating from the very beginning, with a very dramatic and suspenseful (but very well executed) finale.

2. Spider Man Into The Spider Verse - The most groundbreaking animated movie of this Generation which is also among one of the top best superhero movies ever made imo.

movies,Home Alone: Kevin’s family never knew,"Home Alone is renowned for covering plot holes: the ticket being thrown away, the power going out. However, watching Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Kevin never told his family that he fought Harry and Marv in the events covered by the first movie. 

All throughout the second film, his family only ever describes him as being left alone during Christmas—never once do they refer to the fact that he fought off two thieves while he was home alone. The only witness to Kevin fighting the thieves was the old man with the snow shovel. One would think that he would have discussed the ordeal with Kevin’s parents. 

It begs the question why Kevin and the neighbor withheld this information from Kevin’s family. A plot hole? Or, alternatively, is there a possibility that Kevin hallucinated the entire events of the first and second films?

movies,Has a live action remake EVER been an improvement upon an animated movie or show? ,"I'm seeing people talk about the live action how to train your dragon, I made a comment on a different site about how in my opinion, no animated movie has ever been improved by being converted to live action.

Aladdin, last Airbender, one piece, jungle book, beauty and the beast, I'd rather watch the original animated work every single time.  

Lion King doesn't count because it's only live action in appearance and is often considered an animated movie since every second of that movie was computer generated besides the first 10 seconds of the sunrise.  

I'm also not talking about different mediums, video game-&gt;movie, book-&gt;movie etc. Only if the original animated and live action remake are both a movie or both a TV show.

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in North Macedonia, and although there weren't really that many suggestions and votes, we were still able to find an interesting winner: ***You Won't Be Alone*** is an australian movie. To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out why an Australian filmmaker made a movie with a plot set in North Macedonia, but maybe I'll get back to this as soon as I've found out more (after the viewing).

But what I would like to find out very quickly is your favorite movie set in **Norway**. I think this time a movie that is genuinely from the country itself could end up on [our official letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) list again, but we'll see... The only thing I'm setting here are just two rules:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

movies,What’s the purpose of a red herring? When are they good and when are they bad?,"In *Late Night With The Devil (2023)*, without giving anything away, there’s a background character that sticks out like a sore thumb.

I got all the way to the end credits assuming that, any second now, they were going to finally step forward and say: “Nyah haaaaahh! It was me! Me all along!”

But no they were nothing.

So, this is a (intentional I think?) red herring. I found it distracting and annoying in this specific case, but it’s such a common trope that there must be a reason for them.

Just at the moment though I can’t think of what it might be. I mean, I definitely don’t have a “favourite red herring”. They’ve always just seemed like a pointless digression, akin to a random background extra walking around with a handful of fireworks for absolutely no reason.

What am I missing here? Because, and I want to completely acknowledge this up front, I appreciate that this is about me missing something. They’re so common they must serve *some* purpose.

movies,A blend of art and fear: Why Hereditary is a must-watch movie. ,"I always thought I didn’t like horror movies. I usually don’t enjoy blood, violence, or scenes designed to disgust. But recently, I watched Hereditary by Ari Aster, which is categorized as a horror movie, and for a change—not only was I not grossed out or anything—I genuinely enjoyed it! There were plenty of scary scenes that made me grab onto whoever was sitting next to me xD, but it was the kind of fear that’s fun and intriguing—I loved being scared.

The casting was excellent. The acting of the mother (Annie) was fantastic, and the choice of Milly Shapiro for the role of the daughter (Charlie) was spot-on, and so on.

The film's atmosphere was mesmerizing; for example, the fact that the mother was a ""miniaturist"" and recreated their home in miniature—it was simply brilliant! It didn’t necessarily add anything significant to the plot, but it contributed something very unique to the movie's vibe.

The scary parts were genuinely frightening, in my opinion, but what was special is that along with my fear, I also found myself laughing.
The amazing director edited the film in such a fantastic way that even in the scary scenes, there was a sense of humor. This movie is truly one of a kind.

In conclusion: Ari Aster, the crown is yours! 👑

The first time he uses the machine, the Machine-Angier that stays put shoots the Teleported-Angier.

So if ""The Real Angier"" teleported that first time, he was shot and killed.

If ""The Real Angier"" didn't teleport, he drowned the first time the trick was performed.

Either way, he's a very smart man. He must know that by the end he's either Angier #100+ or Angier #2, which I think is why he breaks down about sacrifice, not the 100+ murders. He knows the original is long dead.

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moana_2) 69% (72 Reviews)

&gt;Riding high on a wave of stunning animation even when its story runs adrift, Moana 2 isn't as inspired as the original but still delights as a colorful adventure.

* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moana-2/):  57 (36 Reviews)

**Reviews**

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho-1236070676/):

&gt;Where Moana focused on the relationship between the titular adventurer and her reluctant demigod companion, Moana 2 divides its attention among more characters. These personalities become window dressing in a movie short on time.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson-auli-i-cravalho-1236222936/):

&gt;Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first “Moana,” at its best, transcended.

[Daily Telegraph] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/) (4/5):

&gt;With a running time that brings us briskly ashore, the film is a grand voyage in miniature -- a taster epic.

[Empire] (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/moana-2/) (4/5):

&gt;A touch less fresh than the original, but this is still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination. It knows the way. 

[USA Today] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/11/26/moana-2-disney-review-release/76466003007/) (3/4):

&gt;The follow-up plots an extremely familiar course but at least does so with fresh new personalities and more inspired Pacific Island influence.

[IndieWire] (https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/moana-2-review-disney-sequel-1235069079/) (B):

&gt;It’s always a tough ask to improve upon an original, but “Moana 2” is a sprightly addition to this sea-faring legacy. It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.

[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):

&gt;Fortunately, much like ""Frozen II,"" ""The Incredibles 2,"" and ""Toy Story 4,"" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.

[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):

&gt;Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There’s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.

[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):

&gt;A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.

[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):

&gt;The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here’s a second movie that’s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that’s what you’re after. If not, well: It’s one hour and 40 minutes.

[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):

&gt;Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.

[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):

&gt;While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn’t feel richer or more exciting.

[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): 

&gt;The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.

[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):

&gt;There’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it’s necessary to write 'there’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.

[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):

&gt;It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.

[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :

&gt;The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.

**Synopsis**:
&gt;“Moana 2” reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.

* Rose Matafeo as Loto
* David Fane as Kele

movies,Good movie scenes for kids to act in a theater camp.,"Putting together an acting camp this winter for kids in 5th and 6th grade. Each day we'll watch a scene from a film, then in groups they'll choose characters, make props, create a twist ending (if they like), choreograph their scenes, and perform them for each other.

Would love to hear thoughts on good scenes for them to act out. Live action or animated, all are welcome. Funny scenes usually work better than emotionally wrenching ones. 3-4 character scenes are often best, but we can also adapt scenes with other amounts of characters. The students are learning English, but they are pretty eager and open to most scenes. Ideally not too much violence as that can digress into chaos perrrty quick.

Below is a list of films that come to mind so far - if you have any favorite scenes from these (or other films), let's get a nice repository going.

movies,"Movie franchise titles that made sense for the first installment, but not for subsequent films","When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like ""Title 2"", ""Title II"", ""Title Part 2"", ""Title: The Revenge"", ""Tit2e"", etc.

This can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.

Sometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.

So what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",AporiaParadox,1h0bbt0,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0bbt0/movie_franchise_titles_that_made_sense_for_the/,2024-11-26 13:01:49,1157,0.93,1157,0,1053,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h0bbt0

Only...if the Pope attempted to dismiss him before he died, he couldn't have done it on the basis of bribery for the Conclave as effectively  that couldn't have happened yet or be foreseen. They repeatedly emphasize that the Pope died unexpectatly, meaning it couldn't have been that Tremblay bribed everyone while the Pope was still alive, in preparation for his death as it were.
Also if this was the case, it would be just so dumb to do it whilst the Pope was still alive.

Bottom row: Roma \(Alfonso Cuarón\), All That Jazz \(Bob Fosse\), The Squid &amp; The Whale \(Noah Baumbach\), Pain &amp; Glory \(Pedro Almodóvar\), The Fabelmans \(Steven Spielberg\), Minari \(Lee-Isaac Chung\)](https://preview.redd.it/wn6ik9p0dl3e1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5028486dea52e2ab4fb0d7c075a9a51dff3938b8)

So one one of the things I've always been fascinated by our directors/writers who go out and make semi-autobiographical films. Obviously, every artist imbues a part of themselves and draws inspiration from their own experiences in whatever they make, regardless of if it's a realistic, domestic situation or a big action fantasy. But it always is interesting when you see films that are clearly drawn from past experiences and how that knowledge of pain and joy can help appreciate a film more.

Sure some may see it as being self-indulgent but some of the best movies of all time have been grown-up, mature directors looking at their lives.

And to be clear, it doesn't just have to be their adolescense/childhood. 

Antonio Banderas had to embody a dramatized adult Pedro Almodóvar reflecting on his path in life. All That Jazz looked at Fosse's career as a dancer, choreographer, and director. Celine Song has said Past Lives was inspired by a real childhood friendship she had prior to moving abroad and their reunion after she'd gotten married. Noah Baumbach has not been afraid of sayig how Marriage Story was inspired by the divorce between he and Jennifer Jason Leigh. And while not one character served as an exact mirror, Platoon was reinforced by Oliver Stone's real life experiences as a Vietnam veteran.

So what directors do would you like to see make a semi-autobiographical film about their own lives? I also want to put an addendum that **you can include directors who are sadly no longer with us and directors who are currently ""retired""**",dremolus,1h1qlk6,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1qlk6/which_directors_you_would_like_to_see_make_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h1qlk6/which_directors_you_would_like_to_see_make_a/,2024-11-28 07:24:28,0,0.35,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Xv2oSuRxDNN0Pwl5Nz6aXNsKoiLDHBLHqIHQ5bFdUQo.jpg,t3_1h1qlk6

movies,Does anyone know if actors/crew have any control over Feature Commentaries?,"This question from having watched the Conclave feature commentary. It was terrific and informative, for me. I love feature commentaries (Emerald Fennell’s for Promising Young Woman and Rian Johnson’s for Knives Out, to mention only two). Here, the director of Conclave clearly admires his actors and crew so much. Yet I thought at moments he was maybe a little too free with the comments about some of the actors: their disagreements over, for example, the costumes (whether they should have been actually what a cardinal would wear or not, etc.). Mostly Tucci and Fiennes. He mentions that Stanley Tucci had doubts about his performance near the end of the shoot, which I am sure is common. From the sound of things, Tucci in real life would probably say, “it’s fine"" (listen to the commentary;-)). Ralph Fiennes apparently was a bit piqued about his costume, because an actual member of the church showed him a costume detail, and Fiennes wondered why Berger wouldn't use it. It’s very here and there. It does NOT sound like the set of an Xmen movie, truly. This director, a wonderful filmmaker, sounds like a very decent and knowledgeable man who truly appreciated his cast and crew. Still, does anyone know if actors or crew members can prescreen these, and give their approval or veto to certain parts?

How do y’all feel about that?

Would you watch a movie even though it’s motivated by studio greed? Like say if a movie like whiplash got a sequel with a brand new director, would you watch it? Or would you watch it if it had the same director as the first one?

- Then there's a shootout at the assisted living facility and Russian nationals are arrested (oh shit, these are REAL thugs)

- then the doctor gets killed (who kill people, fr!!)

- then SHE is nearly killed, and in the process discovers her girlfriend is nearly blown up (damn, my eyebrows got burnt off)

and I remind you, at this point, she's never dealt with anything nearly approaching this. And instead of trying to bring this ordeal to a close, an ordeal FAR above her experience, she makes a final stand. Her and her army-of-one girlfriend.

movies,Earl holliman passed away yesterday at 96,"While at the Pasadena Playhouse, Holliman entered the Paramount lot by claiming he had an appointment with a studio barber. Eventually he became friendly with studio executives. Holliman first got a small bit part opposite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in Scared Stiff (1953). Next he was cast as a marine in The Girls of Pleasure Island (1953), for which he needed a G.I. haircut. Finally he saw the barber and ended up with a haircut (and bangs) that changed his life.

After he gained popularity in his image following a change in hairstyle, he then followed with three more films released in 1953.His many credits include: Broken Lance (1954), The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), The Big Combo (1955), I Died a Thousand Times (1955), Forbidden Planet (1956), Giant (1956), The Rainmaker (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Don't Go Near the Water (1957), Hot Spell (1958), The Trap (1959), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), Visit to a Small Planet (1960), Armored Command (1961), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Anzio (1968), The Desperate Mission (1969), Smoke (1970), The Biscuit Eater (1972), The Solitary Man (1979), Sharky's Machine (1981) and Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge (1987).

Holliman played a doomed helicopter crewman in the William Holden war drama The Bridges at Toko-Ri and a gangster's double-crossed thug in The Big Combo.

He starred in The Rainmaker (1956), opposite Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, playing a rancher's timid son, who finally must defy his brother to gain self-respect, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture; he was cast in the role instead of Elvis Presley.

I just recently watched Her and maybe it's recency bias but it was immediately one of the most impactful movies I've ever seen. It's affected me greatly. Suffering is universal. Also an outstanding soundtrack

Good Will Hunting has always been a favorite of mine. The cinematography, the writing, the growth. It's beautiful. Also an amazing soundtrack.

movies,What do you think is the first 80s move and the last 70s movie,"Probably more than any adjacent decades, I think the shift from 70s to 80s ethos and vibes is just incredible.  

When I think of 70s films, there are lots of themes we see that they created whole genres out of: 

City in Decline:  Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, The French Connection, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, The Warriors,  The Taking of Pelham One Two Three

Political and Paranoid Thrillers:  Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation, Marathon Man, Klute, Capricorn One, Chinatown, Winter Kills, The Day of the Jackal, All the President's Men, Chinatown

War Movies Shifted from Heroic to Pathos of War:  Coming Home, Deer Hunter, Patton, MASH, The Big Red One, Catch 22, Slaughterhouse 5, Apocalypse Now

Dystopic Sci-fi:  Logan's Run, A Clockwork Orange, The Omega Man, West World, The Andromeda Strain, Mad Max

Loss of the American Dream:  The Last Picture Show, American Graffiti, Nashville

The 80s. . . Instead of gritty realism we get escapism:

Raiders of the Lost Ark, Top Gun, The Empire Strikes Back

Instead of anti-heroes, we get heroes

Superman, Indiana Jones, Terminator, Die Hard, Commando

Instead of city in decline, we get consumerism and excess: 

Wall Street, Beverly Hills Cops,

A return to more triumphant themes in war movies: 

Red Dawn, The Hunt for Red October, 

An explosion of Teen Movies: 

The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Risky Business, 

Dystopic -Sci Fi is still a thing, but it becomes much bigger, infused with large budgets and massive world-building:

Blade Runner, The Road Warrior

I'd say in terms of cross-overs, Jaws feels like almost like an 80s film - certainly the first of the big blockbusters that everyone chases in the 1980s.  

The Thing is a good example of a 1980s movie firmly grounded in 1970s ethos and themes.

movies,Massive problem with Godfather part 2,"Godfather 2 is generally recognized as an all-time classic as it was nominated and won numerous Oscars and featured some outstanding performances. It's also one of my own favorite movies but I have one problem with it and I think I'm not alone. In short it's Michael's body guard. You know, the guy who wore an all black suit, black hat and black turtleneck while visvisiting Miami and Havana? He mostly stands in the background trying to look menacing but his advanced age and slow ambulation just made me think Hyman Roth could easily just walk away from him even with his heart condition. It's strongly implied that this man in black is a highly accomplished hitman/bodyguard given that Michael entrusts his own security to this one geriatric, zoombified stiff. But when it's time for him to shine, when he gets the call to show us what he's got he fails oh so miserably it's cringe worthy. First, when he takes out Johnny Ola he chooses for his weapon a wooden clothes hanger, never mind that even mild pressure on the cross bar will cause structural failure, but during the scene he loses his left hand grip on the hanger thus losing any leverage he may have conceivably had. Yet, Johnny drops into unconsciousness pretty damn quick, talk about being soft for a gangster. The man in black follows this up by following Roth to a hospital where he takes his sweet time to secure the room before making his move on the  utterly defenseless Roth. Does he pull a gun? No. A knife? No. A blunt object? No. Instead he opts for what looks like the kind of pillow you would get on a Jet Blue flight. His final act of pure incompetance is holding said pillow in a futile defensive act when police burst into the room underscore that this guy was completely unqualified to be a professional hit man. That sums up my complaint, and I understand that some will disagree with my assessment because he's part of one of the greatest films of all time but if you defend the man in black, you are just plain wrong and need to go back stream the film and you will be convinced that he was just plain lame.

I am volunteering at an upcoming event involving a section called “Name that Christmas a movie”. It states that I need to give a vague/simple synopsis and/or hint about a movie so people can guess. Does anyone have any suggestions? I think the movie has to be decently known such as Home Alone, but I’ll take any suggestions and see what to use!

I would appreciate a couple examples if possible.  ",revell_786,1h157pq,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h157pq/anyone_have_ideas/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h157pq/anyone_have_ideas/,2024-11-27 14:12:21,0,0.4,0,0,11,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h157pq
movies,Hot Fuzz - 2007,"At this point, the Cornetto trilogy is somewhat of a modern cult phenomenon. The pick of the three for me would have to be the love letter to 80's action movies, Hot Fuzz.

There are endless quotes that you will be repeating for years, a stellar cast headed by the amazing Simon Pegg (Sgt. Nicholas Angel) and Nick Frost (PC Danny Butterman) and a storyline which is beautifully crafted.

Times are tough for London Police Constable Nicholas Angel. He's had a break up, living in quarters and was stabbed in December by a man dressed, as Father Christmas! 

The most successful officer in the Met has received a promotion to sergeant, in Sanford Gloucestershire, statistically, the safest village in the country.

movies,The original DVD version of Pulp Fiction ,"I was recently going to buy the 4K version of Pulp Fiction, but I'm wondering if the higher detail goes against the Directors vision of how this movie should be watched?  
It's no secret that Quentin Tarantino is not a fan of 4K and I'm wondering if making that movie more prettier goes against the aesthetics of it being a genre picture? Something in the vain of Grindhouse and 70's exploitation movies, whereas cleaning it up maybe makes it look more like an ""prestige"" picture? Which it is, but only after the fact.   
I wonder, because I remember the first press of DVD's back in the day for this movie, and it was a ""dirty"" transfer, which was the version I first fell in love with.   
There is definitely some nostalgia on my part, but I'm also thinking that a ""dirty"" transfer does give a better sense of how it might have been at the movies showing a 35mm print that's been continuously played to being worn out.   
I'm wondering if the quality of 4K restoration goes against the original mood of this movie?

movies,"""Mary Reilly"" (1996): Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde through the eyes of a shy house maid. Maligned by the critics, it is a grim and moody film about the evil within us.","I loved Mary Reilly and it wasn't the folly the critics kept announcing it to be. I loved the setting, the emphasis on the claustrophic nature of the house, the menacing sensuality of Hyde compared to the introverted Jekyl, played brilliantly by John Malkovich. There are scenes that literally shock you like when Hyde stomps a little girl to near death or every scene featuring Glenn Close as Mrs Faraday, in the scariest performance I've ever seen from her. Faraday made Alex from Fatal Attraction look harmless by comparison. 

The brunt of the bad reviews was Julia Roberts and, to be honest, I didn't think she was that bad. On the contrary, I thought she gave a good performance as Mary Reilly. Was the accent bad? I don't know, but I did feel Roberts disappeared into this part, she made me believe she was a withdrawn and awkward maid with a dark past who becomes intrigued, fascinated and sexually attracted to Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. I can't help but believe Roberts was unjustly targeted because she was America's sweetheart playing such an against type of role.

The entire movie reminded me of ""The Company of Wolves"". At least, the direction. It had a bit of that eerie atmosphere with the fog and the cold brick houses. It made me think Stephen Frears could have done a Jack the Ripper movie. That would have been a riveting movie to watch.",Peter_Omun,1h0ltao,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0ltao/mary_reilly_1996_dr_jekyl_and_mr_hyde_through_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h0ltao/mary_reilly_1996_dr_jekyl_and_mr_hyde_through_the/,2024-11-26 20:24:43,5,0.61,5,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h0ltao
