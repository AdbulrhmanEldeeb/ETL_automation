books,Bent right to your wind sounds like a promising upcoming novel : Academic rivals to friends to lovers to marriage in crisis. ,"Has anyone else seen the promotion of this book on Instagram ? I feel like it sounds slightly unique or maybe i just like how the MMC and FMC look in the cover. It reminds me of Anne and Gilbert from Anne of green gables who were also academic rivals that eventually got married.

I always find it interesting how some books have kind of a combination between enemies and friends to lovers. Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter and Gilbert and Anne from Anne of Green gables would these be classified as friends to lovers or enemies to lovers? Ron and Hermione were clearly both friends and rivals at the same time whereas I suppose Gilbert and Anne went from rivals to friends to lovers. Except when they were rivals, it was more from Anne's side than Gilbert. The thing i slightly disliked about Anne and Gilbert is that Gilbert became a doctor and Anne didn't do much with her career. But in another way, I actually like that the author did that because it is realistic - sometimes you do well in school, you basically peak in school but don't do well after that. If it was me, I may not have wanted to get with my ex academic rival because i d feel bad that he did well for himself and I didn't. What about you guys ?

I think Bent right to your wind is very slightly different in the sense that we get to see what its like after the couple get married and see them possibly grow back together.

I just don't like the title of the book, it doesn't sound very romantic because it is like 'pass wind'. Maybe a better title could have been Bent right to your Aura/soul.

This is the blub for anyone interested : *Aaron Willow and Maya Amery’s story began with a book in a park, a budding friendship between a golden-hearted boy and a jaded, independent girl. But what started as an innocent connection soon turned into something deeper—and more complicated—when a betrayal disrupted their lives. Setting them on a path of academic competition, with each pushing the other to their limits while keeping buried feelings at bay.*

*Years later, Aaron and Maya are married, but the love that once bound them is now strained under the weight of the past. Nearly a decade into marriage, they’re confronted by a painful reminder of that old betrayal—a wound neither of them caused, yet one that reshaped their lives and relationship forever.*

*As the story unfolds through dual timelines, we see Aaron and Maya’s journey from friends to rivals to lovers, and finally, to a couple fighting for their love against the scars of the past.*

*Can they rediscover the magic they once shared, or will the shadows of yesterday prove too strong to overcome?*

***A tale of love, rivalry, and resilience, where each chapter alternates between the innocence of youth and the trials of a marriage in peril.***",AltruisticAide9776,1h43qmv,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h43qmv/bent_right_to_your_wind_sounds_like_a_promising/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h43qmv/bent_right_to_your_wind_sounds_like_a_promising/,2024-12-01 13:53:29,0,0.17,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h43qmv
books,"Son's prof taught them that The Hobbit is misogynistic because of lack of female characters and I am confused, outraged, and heartbroken","I love *The Hobbit*. It is one of my favourite childhood books, and favourite books ever. I read and reread it as a child till I knew chunks of it by heart, I still do. It is part of my emotional / mental landscape, along with a few other works (and unlike that godawful sprawling Lord of the Ring shite, which I sludged through at the age of fifteen out of a sense of duty, and never touched again). When my son was little, I remember telling him bits of *The Hobbit* (the escape with the eagles, the spiders, Gollum, Smaug) as bedtime stories. 

So when he (now a 19-year old who of course knows everything about everything) was assigned *The Hobbit* in a Pop Culture course (he's in maths, but he needs to take some mandatary writing/humanities credits, and this one happened to fit his schedule), I was delighted. I always love it when my children read the books I did as a child, and I envisaged lots of cozy conversation between us about how wonderful *The Hobbit* is. I was worried he would hate it (remembering an unfortunate episode where my daughter, then 13, declared Lloyd Alexander's Prydain to be sexist and Taran beyond annoying, and refused to finish the series)

Well, my son also fell in love with *The Hobbit*! That was marvelous! He loved Bilbo, he related to him, being pressured to go do ""fun"" things with friends who are bigger taller stronger cooler than he is, the adventures, Bilbo's wit and survival instincts, all of it! We did indeed have lots of conversations, and I read his essays and ended up reading the Fafnir mythology- all good. 

Then, a couple of nights ago, he is studying for finals, and he mentions the OP title. That the prof says *The Hobbit* is misogynistic because it doesn't have female characters. 

Now, I grew up in an academic family, and although not an academic myself, I have orbitted academia for many years, so I am absolutely used to hearing profs spout dumb things, like, all the time. But really? Like, how stupid are we talking? 

Not living in a hole like Bilbo, and indeed being an enthusiastic consumer of Pop Culture, I am of course aware of the trend, and hopefully not just a trend! of casting all sorts of characters with diverse backgrounds, abilities, sexualities, and genders, and it's all good! I love it! You will never catch foaming at the mouth that Ariel is Black! Go for it!

But now I *am* metaphorically foaming at the mouth. Beloved works are judged, in an incompetent and self-serving way, by standards never agreed to, never even knew about.

Let me make it clear (maybe, hopefully, the prof is on Reddit??), simply not having characters of different genders, races, abilities, does not make a book ""against"" those identities. Writing about creatures of similar identities does not make you ""against"" the identities not written about. Does your work preach hatred, othering, narrow-mindedness, bigotry and various phobias? Then it is not \[insert identity\]-phobic. Does *The Hobbit* explicitly or implicitly say women are lesser than men, and should be differently treated as a result of that? No? Then it's not misogynistic. Simply writing about what is essentially a boys' trip is not misogynistic.

Anyway, the nice thing was, my son did not agree with prof! So clearly I have done my work well :)

I know what is going in the story but it's very very boring. I can't read it because of the complex words....I have to look again again in dictionary for the words , i just cant read the full page without searching in dictionary. I thought that when paul and his mother will go into the desert it will be very easy to read but it became more complex. I cant understand the places he is explaining... Like ""They came to a series of dropping shelves and beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule"". And now i cant understand the part where paul pack is lost in the fissure , how he find it using compass and spice and water. Usually when i like a book i always think about it whole day what is going to happen , also at nights i will think about it , will wake to read at night, my morning will start with reading.

books,The Tearsmith (SPOILERS),"Ok, so I’m not usually a romance reader. However, I’m sometimes known for picking up a romance or two when I want something different for a bit. Which is how I came to read the Tearsmith by Erin Doom. 

Now, I don’t know if any of you have read this, but I can’t express how bad I found this book. I was a little intrigued by the premise, but my god was this book boring. The main characters grow up in an abusive orphanage together, something that colors literally all of their actions/interactions with each other, but we barely get to see what actually happened there. Instead, we get nearly 600 pages of, well, nothing. The chapters are incredibly repetitive, and drag on and on for no reason. The narration, which is usually in first-person, is pretentious and, again, repetitive. I want to excuse some of this, because I assume the translation from Italian to English was not perfect, but that does not excuse the way the main character is only able to talk in metaphors, and constantly talks about the same thing over and over again.

And the characters. My god. The main character, Nica, is written as “frail, delicate, and innocent.” And these are words that are actually used to describe her in the book. Actually, she’s written more like a 6-year old child. She’s obsessed with Rigel, the orphan she grew up with, and is constantly staring at him and thinking about how gorgeous and “dark” he is, and compares him to a wolf about 70 times. She’s clearly meant to be “not like other girls,” but she just comes off as an idiot. And Rigel. Jesus. He’s supposed to be the dark and tortured love interest, but in reality he’s a huge bully and can’t handle Nica touching him or he’ll “lose control” and ravish her against a wall or whatever. And every time he commands her to stay away, he gets as close to her as humanly possible and she trembles and shakes and can’t breathe. He also tries to “protect” her for all the guys who fall in love with her due to her “unique” eyes, something that is repeated over and over again. And she’s too naive to know that all these guys are disgusting and want to take advantage of her. 

Also, the book should have ended at least 6 chapters before it actually did. The author just kept adding more and more for no reason. The first couple of times I was like “ok, I guess she could add something else,” and then I just ended up skimming the last couple of chapters because they were so useless. If Nica had stopped waxing poetic over how dark and tortured and wolf-life Rigel was, the book would have been half its size. 

Has anyone else read this? Am I just being overly judgmental?

books,Why Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy is a deeply unsettling work of fiction,"This book is wild. Just reading the back cover, I knew I was in for something crazy, but *Outer Dark* surpassed even my wildest expectations.

*Outer Dark* back cover:

*""A woman bears her brother's child, a boy; he leaves the baby in the woods and tells her he died of natural causes. Discovering her brother's lie, she sets forth alone to find her son. Both brother and sister wander separately through a countryside being scourged by three terrifying and elusive strangers, headlong toward an eerie, apocalyptic resolution.""*

This is an extremely dark read, but I loved every word McCarthy wrote. It was fantastic.

As I mentioned in my review of All the Pretty Horses, Cormac McCarthy is probably my favourite author. *Outer Dark* continues to reinforce that belief.

Interestingly, as I started reading *Outer Dark*, a Vanity Fair article surfaced claiming that Cormac McCarthy had a 16-year-old muse late in his life. While I haven’t been able to access the full article due to subscription barriers, the excerpts and discussions I’ve encountered paint the piece as overly stylized, almost as if the author is attempting to mimic McCarthy’s own prose. This stylistic choice, combined with the extraordinary claims made, makes the story feel exaggerated, if not dubious. I’m not dismissing the possibility that some of it might be true—if it is, it’s deeply troubling—but the lack of concrete evidence and the outlandish nature of certain allegations leave me skeptical. It’s also worth noting that McCarthy is no longer alive to respond or clarify these claims. While the article has sparked debates about separating art from the artist, I believe McCarthy’s literary contributions remain vital. His works deserve to be read and analyzed, even as we remain mindful of the complexities surrounding his personal life.

Now, back to *Outer Dark*.

This is an amazing piece of fiction. From the very beginning, the book is relentlessly dark. Set in Appalachia, McCarthy creates an eerie, almost fantastical world that feels alive in its desolation. The brother and sister live in an isolated shack deep in the woods, and when they venture out on their separate journeys, they encounter a cast of vivid and unforgettable characters. Some of these figures are helpful, while others are downright malevolent. These secondary characters breathe so much life—and death—into the story, amplifying its intensity.

The first time Culla Holme, the brother, meets the three elusive strangers face-to-face, right after his ride on the ferry, is one of the creepiest scenes I’ve ever read. The way McCarthy describes the shadows moving in the clearing and the strangers’ unsettling mannerisms—how they move, stare, laugh, and speak—is masterful. The tension is almost unbearable.

You know they’ll return, and when they do, McCarthy doesn’t disappoint.

*""Well, I see ye didn't have no trouble findin us.*  
*I wasn't huntin ye.*  
*You got here all right for somebody bound elsewhere.*  
*I wasn't bound nowheres. I just seen the fire.*  
*I like to keep a good fire. A man never knows what all might chance along. Does he?*  
*No.*  
*No. Anything's liable to warsh up. From nowheres nowhere bound.*  
*Where are you bound? Holme said.*  
*I ain't, the man said. By nothin. He looked up at Holme. We ain't hard to find. Oncet you've found us.""*

This scene is haunting, and when the strangers appear again—with the one-eyed baby and the tinker in the tree—the atmosphere is downright terrifying. I’m not sure if *Outer Dark* is officially considered a horror novel, but it’s probably the scariest book I’ve ever read.

I’m not a big horror reader. People rave about Stephen King, but I haven’t been impressed. I’ve read *The Dead Zone* and *The Shining*, and neither really did it for me. I actually prefer Kubrick’s adaptation of *The Shining* because it improved on the source material in tone and execution. That said, I love Dan Simmons, I mostly know him as a science fiction author, however, I read Drood and loved it, though it wasn’t the horror elements that hooked me. If you have horror recommendations, I’d love to explore more.

But *Outer Dark*? It qualifies as horror in my book.

Religious themes also run deep in this story, coming to the forefront in the latter half. One of the most memorable scenes is when Holme meets the hog drovers. After one of their brothers dies and Holme gets blamed, a preacher shows up, declaring his guilt without any knowledge of the situation. The absurdity of this preacher, casually pronouncing judgment, is both comical and thought-provoking—a sharp critique of blind religious authority.

Rinthy Holme, Culla’s sister, has her own strange and fascinating encounters, though none are as grotesque as her brother’s.

This was an incredible read. Any Cormac McCarthy fan needs to pick up *Outer Dark*. Being one of his earlier works, it’s not as widely discussed as some of his other novels, but it deserves to be. It’s right up there with the rest of his literature in my opinion. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend *Outer Dark* as a starting point for McCarthy newcomers, but for fans, it’s an absolute must-read.",Sudden-Database6968,1h3gwu8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3gwu8/why_outer_dark_by_cormac_mccarthy_is_a_deeply/,2024-11-30 16:59:00,109,0.7,109,0,68,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3gwu8

books,Do you think understanding is necessary for enjoyment of literature?,"I have tried reading Ulysses but just can't get through it. Here's a paragraph from the second chapter.

&gt;It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Sainte Geneviève where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.

Some chapters get easier but then we're back to more literary experimentations and Joyce basically showing off his amazing knowledge of things.

I was having trouble and someone who said he was reading through the classics in his free time said just read through it. And that he had read Ulysses in just a week, which I found astonishing. Did  he read it carefully, I wondered? He said he didn't get a lot of stuff but it doesn't matter, he still enjoyed it.

Anyhow, I said I I can't read what I don't understand. like I first need to learn more about philosophy, history, religion, Ireland, etc. Or at least need to have a few books and webpages open to look up each reference Joyce makes (and he makes plenty). And that is assuming I can understand his stream-of-consciousness style which I often can't. So it will definitely take me way longer than a week or two.

Some other people also report difficulties with Joyce but also passages or books from other writers, like Faulkner, Woolf, Pynchon, and so on. Yet there are many people who would tell you they enjoyed the work and had no issues. Yet, when you ask them more questions, you realize they did not necessarily understand what they read.

So where do you stand? Do you think one should take the same approach to literature as we often do to poetry, to accept there will always remain some mystery and we will never know certain things for sure? And that perhaps we don't even need to know them. Or do you think that unless one really understands a book they are reading, they are not putting in the effort the type of book demands and perhaps they can't claim to have really read the book?

books,Napoleon Bonaparte's 'On Suicide': A Teenager's Emo Moment with a Side of Anti-French Sentiment,"I recently read Napoleon's essay 'On Suicide,' written when he was 17. In this essay, Napoleon contemplates death and expresses deep despair, feeling isolated and unable to find meaning in life. He reflects on his alienation from his homeland and his growing frustration with the world around him. He even goes as far as to contemplate suicide as an escape from his misery. At this time, young Napoleon harbored strong anti-French sentiments, influenced by his identity as a Corsican and his resentment towards the French government, which he viewed as an oppressor. This anti-French outlook, combined with his personal anguish, shaped much of his early writings.

But, honestly, I don't think Bonaparte was seriously contemplating suicide. It’s more likely that he was dealing with sexual repression. Shortly after writing this essay, he met his first love, and—surprise—his mood seemed to lift. The depression and suicidal thoughts vanished. (probably because the sexual repression was resolved. Sorry just for a joke.)

At the time, Bonaparte often used exaggerated expressions of anger and frustration. For example, in 'The New Corsica,' he describes Corsicans slaughtering the French in a bloodbath, and in 'On Suicide,' he writes of his deep sorrow and desire to end it all. But we shouldn’t take these youthful outbursts literally. Just because he once wrote about killing the French doesn’t mean he spent his whole life plotting their demise. Later, his sense of identity shifted from being a Corsican to a 'French Corsican,' and instead of focusing on the French, he turned his attention to Austria and England.

I have carefully read the original French version and also created a Chinese translation. However, since English is more commonly used in Reddit communities, I will share the English version here:

# On Suicide - Napoleon Bonaparte

*Valence, May 3rd 1786*

Always alone in the midst of men, I return home to dream alone and abandon myself to all the intensity of my melancholy. Where did it lead today? Towards death.

At the dawn of my days I can still hope to live long. I have been absent from my fatherland for six or seven years. Which pleasures will I not feel in four months to see my compatriots and my parents! From the tender sensations which awaken the sweet memories of childhood, could I not conclude that my happiness will be complete?

What fury then leads me to want my destruction? No doubt, what to do in this world? If I must die, is it not better to kill myself? If I had already passed sixty years, I would respect the prejudice of my contemporaries and patiently wait for nature to achieve its course; but since I begin to feel misfortune, that nothing pleases me, why should I endure days in which nothing succeeds?

How far men are from nature! How cowardly, vile, and crawling they are! What spectacle will I see in my country? My compatriots heavy with chains, and who trembling kiss the hand which oppresses them! They are no longer these brave Corsicans which a hero animated of his virtues, enemy of tyrants, of the luxury of vile courtisans. Proud, full of the noble sentiment of his own importance, a Corsican lived happily if he had spent the day tending to public affairs. The night spent in the tender arms of a dear wife?

Reason and his enthusiasm erased all the troubles of the day. Tenderness, nature, rendered his nights comparable to that of the Gods. But, with freedom, those happy days vanished like dreams! Frenchmen, not content with having taken from us everything we cherished, you have also corrupted our mores.

The current condition of my fatherland and my powerlessness to change it, are thus yet another reason to flee a land where I am obligated by duty to praise men whom I ought by virtue to hate. When I will arrive in my fatherland, how must I act, which language should I hold?

When the fatherland is no more, a good patriot should die. If I had only one man to destroy to deliver my compatriots, I would leave this instant and plunge in the breast of the tyrants the vengeful sword of the fatherland and of violated laws.

Life is a burden to me because I taste no pleasure and everything is sorrow. It is a burden because the men with whom I live and will probably always live with have mores as far from mine as moonlight differs from that of the sun. I can therefore not follow the only manner of living which could make me endure life, from which follows disgust for everything.",Illustrious-Most6097,1h36f2r,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h36f2r/napoleon_bonapartes_on_suicide_a_teenagers_emo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h36f2r/napoleon_bonapartes_on_suicide_a_teenagers_emo/,2024-11-30 06:22:21,60,0.8,60,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h36f2r
books,Ender's Game Empathy?,"I teach Language and Literature to middle school students and we have an upcoming unit around the book *Ender's Game*. I last read it when I was about their age and really enjoyed it, but going through it again with a more analytical perspective there are some things I'm left really wondering about. The main thing is the idea of empathy being Ender's key to defeating his opponents. We're told this several times throughout the book, and we definitely see some scenes of him being highly empathetic, but I don't really see it come into play in terms of him being able to defeat his enemies.

&gt;!In the fights he has with Stilson and Bonzo he's able to goad them into fighting one on one, and a case could be made that he needs a degree of empathy in order to be able to successfully do that, but the entire rest of the time he's at the Battle School does he use empathy at all to win his battles? It seems to me that he just outthinks everyone else and comes up with better strategies while they all run the same basic patterns.!&lt;

&gt;!And of course, the biggest, most important battles are the ones against the Buggers. He's explicitly told by Mazer and Graff after defeating them that they needed someone who could empathize with them in order to understand and defeat them, but where does that actually happen? He knows next to nothing about them other than what Graff and Mazer tell him about their communication and the way they act as units of a whole rather than individuals. In fact, Ender doesn't even realize that he's actually fighting them at any point. He believes he's playing a computer simulation directed by Mazer, so if he's actually empathizing with an opponent in order to defeat them, wouldn't he be trying to do so with Mazer?!&lt;

&gt;!Am I missing something with this book? I think it's a good example of sci-fi for middle school students, which is what we're using it to teach, but I'm really not seeing empathy being central to Ender's success so much as just his intelligence.!&lt;",Heck_Tate,1h3381y,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3381y/enders_game_empathy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h3381y/enders_game_empathy/,2024-11-30 03:13:30,68,0.81,68,0,79,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3381y
books,The Grapes of Wrath,"I just finished *The Grapes of Wrath* by John Steinbeck. It was my first time reading the novel, though I’ve read some of his other work like *Of Mice and Men* in high school and *Cannery Row* just last year. He’s probably my favorite American author (so far). 

I found myself a little disappointed by all the loose ends. Where did Noah go? Why did he think his family didn’t love him? What will Rose of Sharon do after being abandoned by her husband? Did they do divorce in absentia back then? Of course, those questions are small potatoes in the face of starvation and death, but my satiated type A brain hones in on that sort of stuff. And the more I think about it, the luckier I feel.

I’m also kind of sad that we started the story with Tom Joad but he was gone by the end.

Rose of Sharon’s pregnancy was interesting. In the beginning, it was her great hope, and it strengthened her union with Connie. I’m guessing as she got further along he realized there was almost no work, and no way to perform the kind of labor necessary to their survival while also fulfilling their dreams of an ideal life. Shit got real. Even before they left for California, it was stated that ROS was no longer the “hoyden” he married but more settled. I took that to mean their connection was a little dubious from then on. 

Long story short: ROS spends a lot of time being tired and worrying about the health of the baby, but the baby is stillborn despite their best efforts. Uncle John sending off the corpse was interesting, given the wife and unborn child he lost so long ago. Maybe it was symbolic for him, letting go of the unknown and unfulfilled potential of the past and looking toward a better future. ROS ends the story by breastfeeding the man in the barn and smiling. That reminded me of the story of Roman Charity, or Cimon and Pero, though the two characters in this case don’t know each other. No idea how to interpret it, but it does seem fitting somehow.",BrieflyBlue,1h32tt7,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h32tt7/the_grapes_of_wrath/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h32tt7/the_grapes_of_wrath/,2024-11-30 02:51:29,63,0.85,63,0,60,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1h32tt7
books,"Can someone explain ""The Silence"" by Don DeLillo to me?","I just DNF'd it at about 70% (which is saying something because the audiobook is only two hours long) because I could not make heads or tails of *anything* that was happening.  I've also never read a Don DeLillo novel, and I'm gathering that this was not the place to start.

Am I not smart enough for this book, or is it just pretentious nonsense??

&gt;!I don't understand the logistic timeline - how does one survive a plane crash, receive treatment at a temporary trauma shelter with no power, have to walk everywhere, and STILL get to a Superbowl party?!&lt;

&gt;!I don't understand the woman at the trauma shelter freaking out about \*specifically\* losing facial recognition abilities. - This was set in 2020, in 2024 I don't use facial recognition technology beyond opening my phone, and as a glasses wearer, that's dicey at best. Ma'am, I don't think that's your biggest loss.  !&lt;

&gt;!I don't understand the physics teacher who seems to barely grasp the concept of ""football"" AT A SUPERBOWL PARTY and constantly talks about the Theory of Relativity. ( The audiobook did him a disservice in that his voice was so monotone and quiet compared to the others that it was difficult to hear what he was saying and he sounded ... inhunman? Like I wondered if there was something wrong with him. Or maybe he was an ai robot and malfunctioning after *the event*.!&lt;

I don't think I've ever been so genuinely bewildered by what happened in a book that I just stopped reading/listening. 

Does it come together in any meaningful way at the end? If it's just &gt;!""Without technology, humans can't communicate cognitively""!&lt; that's pretty annoying.

books,Reading culture pre-1980s,"I am on the younger side, and I have noticed how most literature conversations are based on ""classic novels"" or books that became famous after the 1980s. 

My question for the older readers, what was reading culture like before the days of Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and Harry Potter? 

From the people I've asked about this irl. The big difference is the lack of YA genre. Sci-fi and fantasy where for a niche audience that was somewhat looked down upon. Larger focus on singular books rather than book series. 

Also alot more people read treasure Island back in the day compared to now. I'm wondering what books where ubiquitous in the 40s- 70s that have become largely forgotten today?

books,"Swimming in the Dark by Tomasz Jedrowski broke me apart, this is such a brilliant book.","Oh lord, it's been minutes since I have finished this book, and perhaps I should've waited some time before giving a review, but oh well, the thoughts and the torment I am facing at this exact moment will be forever lost to time. I loved this book, it's an understatement, ofcourse. This book tore through my heart and ripped my soul apart, is this also an understatement? Probably. Swimming in the Dark is a tale of daring homosexual first love in the complicated and conservative times of the 1980s, I am speechless, I don't know what to say or even how to say for a matter of fact.    
  
The first half of this book felt so real, so painful and so joyous, this book portrays the torment of gay love and relationships in such profound and intense depths; societal pressures and the corrupted bigoted world that we currently live in, suppressing our true self for the sake of survival, not being able to display our love and our true identity. The torment and the pain that run through ourselves, the agony and utter melancholy of being a homosexual in this world of prejudice. As a gay male, having faced similar experiences, this made my insides coil up and burst into flames. This is perhaps the most realest book I've read, to me atleast.

This book meticulously dwells into the joy of having a place to be yourself, to have a place where you no longer have to wear that mask and finally display your raw and true identity, a place where you could be yourself, moments where you are true to yourself, be true and real to your lover. I don't know man, even writing this review, my heart is beating like a cheetah, I dont know. We follow the life of Ludwik our narrator and his experience after he met Janusz, the love of his life in the military camp after graduation. Their begins the quest of them finding each other, falling in each others embraces and finding true love. The societal homophobic and bigoted views at that time is masterfully portrayed, how you have to always act, how you can never be yourself and always put the mask on that the society thinks is ""normal"", how homosexuality is perceived as abnormality in those times and how it was severely looked down upon. You can't even show feminine attitude, you have to be a rigid masculine figure like all others, always concealing the true self behind.

What I even could relate and adored was the portrayal of self hatred and resentment of oneself, the shame that eats you up for being gay, for not being ""normal"" according to others, the pain, the torment and the underlying fear of what will happen if others know? How should you act if others know? The never ending uncertainty and fear that always will linger within your mind, not leaving at all. Janusz and Ludwik, the book masterfully builds up their relationship and the intimacy that bloomed between them as it pushed on, showing that what true love is and how daring and fierceful it is. The prose is excellent, wow, simple words and simple sentences but arranged and crafted so beautifully and realistically that made me love the book even more, I was almost at the verge of tears because how beautiful and heart-shattering the language was, how moments displayed were so vivid and so full of life.

But they couldn't be together, not in this lifetime, their different views on politics and their own country separated the courses of their lives, dashed and divided into a million stars long gone in the midnight. Context I guess, please consider me as I am not really that knowledgeable regarding the post WW2 Cold War (The Soviet Period) and the impact faced by Poland in that time. To get free from the totalitarian authority and gain freedom was Ludwiks lurking goal, he never protested, but he always wanted a true and free Poland, he wanted to leave the country with Janusz to find a place where they could be together and be their own, but life isn't a checklist or black and white. Janusz was along the side of The Party from the beginning and, for him you must remain true to The Party to get a stable job and secure a stable life, but he knew, he wasn't blind, he knew about the prejudice and the torment that this authority laid over Polish people and its utter cruelty, but you have to be true to The Party to lead a stable life. His mentality circled around the concept of not leaving the country, because what can you do and will you have when you leave the country? This was the thread that started their separation, while we might not be able to understand it first, but this created the domino effect.

To conceal yourself and wearing a mask, being so true to the mask takes upon your identity and hides your true self underneath, you completely being oblivious to what it does to the one you love, Janusz completely being oblivious to what it did to Ludwik, I still believe Janusz loved no one other than Ludwik, but to play the act, he reached depths from which Ludwik would never pull him up. Having sex and being intimate with Hania, even if all this is foolery, how can you be true to your lover then? Janusz? He couldn't be true to him, he never could, a mask that eats away your life and the thing that matters the most to you. This is heartbreaking, my heart is still racing by the way, this book left me in a desolate state of despair and pain from the moment I turned over the last page, wow, just wow. This is what I consider a masterpiece, peeled layers and layers of my soul and made me feel all emotions ranging from joy and happiness to sorrow and dread, they could never be together, in this cursed life, couldn't even get the chance of saying proper goodbyes, regrets and shame, and to live an identity of not one's own. Their last moments together were heartbreaking, smoking cigarettes and staring into the dark, Oh God, I might cry. To even think of that part, the part where Ludwik reaches to Janusz to tell him he'll be leaving, leaving everything behind, leaving them and their love behind, leaving them, their moments and their life behind, fuck, I will cry. Gosh, this is so painful.

Friendship, and being together for your friends, a section which was also beautifully displayed in this book, supporting and being there for your own people, people who mean alot to you, reminded me of my own true friends and their significance in my life. Helplessness and depravity, living falsely to yourself are strong themes that lurked throughout the book and left it's impact with every passing page

I felt the narrators (Ludwik's) pain and suffereing in my own veins and felt his joys and moments of happiness in my own soul, this is such a brilliant book that displays alot about the world we live in and the melancholic fates of Homosexual back in those time periods. I loved it and this book will forever remain within myself.  I will quote alot of paragraphs and texts now, so please bear with me haha. This is a literary masterpiece, I don't know if I will ever heal from this. Strong feelings similar Lie With Me by Phillipe Besson (Another literary masterpiece, highly recommended). Giovanni's Room is referenced multiple times in significant depths throughout this book and I must read it now, while it was already high in my reading list of books, it just got much more significant. I shall reread this after finishing Giovanni's Room to connect more with the segments where it was mentioned, HOLY HELL. Gosh, I'm sorry for tweaking so much. No matter what I say, and how much I say, I can't put to words how much this book means to me and how much it truly affected me. Absolutely wounded me to the core, I doubt whether I can ever recover. I am genuinely blessed to have the chance of reading it, I rarely say this but I mean it.

Under the surface of the water something warm rattled in my belly. I approached, until I could see the drops of water on your forehead and on the tip of your nose and in the corners of your mouth. We didn’t say a thing. We looked at each other, already beyond words. You were there, and I was there, close, breathing. And I moved into your circle. All the way to your waiting body and your calm, open face and the drops on your lips. Your arms closed around me. Hard. And then we were one single body floating in the lake, weightless, never touching the ground.""***

(This is so beautiful oh my god)

***""I felt your chest underneath your shirt, retraced the swing of your collarbones, the hardness of your shoulders. You tasted the same, warm and earthy. I pulled off your clothes in the dim light. Your tan was still visible, and around us the house was alive—feet shuffled below, water pipes gurgled, taps were turned on and off, accompanying our struggles. Later, when night had fallen and we had exhausted ourselves, we lay facing each other, the tip of your nose on the bridge of mine. Nothing else mattered in the dark.""***

***""I sat in the hallway and tried not to cry. I wanted to cease existing. I wanted to un-be. I sat in the hallway and tried not to think of you and me. I tried not to think of us, under the covers of your bed. I tried not to think of your arms or your hands or your eyes. I tried not to think of all the things I had imagined we’d do together—return to our lake next summer, move in together someday. I tried not to think of Hania, and your fingers on her sequined dress. I tried not to think of Maksio or his eyes when he saw us in the forest. I tried not to think of Granny or Professor Mielewicz.""***

(This quote nearly made me cry)

***""We searched for words, each one of us, trying to say something that meant anything. In the end, we just said goodbye. We said it casually, like we would see each other again soon or maybe like people who had never been much more than acquaintances. You two walked off, arm in arm, and I watched you, the burning cigarette still in my hand, the last thing you’d ever given me.""***

(There last moments together, fuck me Ill cry)

***""Not one example of a happy couple made up of boys. How were we supposed to know what to do? Did we even believe that we deserved to get away with happiness?""***

***""I’ve held on to the idea of us, scanning faces for a scrap of something known, searching for the familiar in the alien. When really, the familiar had already turned alien, and home had ceased being home. Both have gone on living and changing without me.""***

I thought it was good, in terms of walking the reader through the scenario of what it must feel like to marry someone from Nigeria and confront the many cultural differences, but of course it's dealing with a wealthy Nigerian husband there so it doesn't reflect everyday life for most people.

books,What novel/series do you think uses the multiple POV most successfully and how?,"I recently finished the first novel in the expanse series after finishing the live action tv adaptation and am about to start the second book and it made me wonder about the use of multiple PoV characters. 

In the book with the exception of the epilogue the first novel has a dual PoV which I think was used very well. But when comparing to the show. Which is very much an ensemble series where you see so much of the world and better expands things that either happen off screen or we’re never mentioned. 

In later books I believe the authors increase the amount of PoV characters which I imagine will be for the benefit of the story. 

What do you think is the best use of this writing style?  Why did it work there. Do you think there is a risk of the story being convoluted.

books,"Just Finished ""Second Child"" by John Saul.","This was a difficult read, but not for the supernatural aspect. I'm glad I finished it, but I don't know if I want to read any more John Saul if this is a common theme in his books.

&gt;!First of all, it's ridiculous and heartbreaking the level of abuse that Melissa undergoes. Everything from her overly-critical and abusive, insane mother, to her jealous half-sister, to the other kids just plain not liking her for literally no reason. ""She's weird"" isn't a good reason, but it's an incredibly common reason that kids use to push other kids to the fringes of high school society. She's quiet because she's suffering, but she's also suffering because she's quiet. It's heart-breaking! !&lt;

&gt;!That being said, I feel like most of the characters are more caricatures, and are difficult to truly relate to. Overly Abused And Disliked Introvert Girl, Snobby Rich Teenage Clique, Evil And Conniving Half-Sister, on and on and on. But none take the cake more than Phillis, Melissa's natural mother and abuser. She is 100% insufferable! Within the first chapter or two, \*I\* wanted to throw her out the window! Good grief, how ridiculous can you get? So it's incredibly infuriating that though she was finally extracted from Melissa's life at the very end, nothing worse happened to her. I wanted her to be thrown from the attic window, impaled on a fence, feral animals eating her limbs, and then a 747 crashes on her nose-first! THAT'S what that lady deserved! !&lt;

&gt;!But let's forget Phillis for a moment, and talk about Teri, the evil half-sister. What bugs me is that no one - NO ONE - even kind of wondered how her house caught on fire in the beginning. I feel that was a bit unrealistic, even for the 1980s. I feel like firefighters worth their salt would have figured out, hey, someone *set* these fires! I was really surprised that it was never addressed, like at *all.* Very weird. That being said, I liked how she got her come-uppance, though I would have loved a suicide note confessing to all the crazy crap she did would have been a great cherry on top. But maybe the indication was that, because Melissa got ALL her memories back in the end, somehow it all came to light. I don't know. !&lt;

&gt;!Charles. The Dad. I can't say much, except he has the ""Clueless Father"" syndrome that a lot of dads in horror featuring children usually have. It's incredibly irritating. Added to this somewhat, how Melissa is able to be bruiseless and woundless in a friggin' bathing suit the day after her mother hurts her fairly prominently is a mystery. I thought for sure that it would lead to Dad seeing the bruises, etc., and might give him a clue about what was going on....but NOPE! Very strange. !&lt;

  
In the end, it wasn't the worst I've ever read, but it was far from the best. A fun read if you like slightly supernatural horror, but not fun if you don't like extensive stories of realistic, blood-boiling levels of child abuse.

books,"Chills in the night: Dean Koontz's ""Night Chills"".","Gotten another Dean Koontz novel finished today, a little bit shorter than the last two, but no less gripping! His 1976 novel ""Night Chills"".

In the town of Black River something is gripping its residents. Something that is driving them to commit acts of heinous violence.

Created by scientists, it is let loose in the town in a terrifying conspiracy, it can unlock the human mind's most deadly potential. And now a few innocent people are caught in a nightmare that is all too real, with death being the only cure.

This one's pretty tight and a little bit shorter, at about 308 pages. But it is very fast paced, a real pressure cooker of a story that builds up really quickly. And there are some pretty brutal moments in this book too, and I do mean brutal! Got a bit more horror, especially a little bit of psych-horror, along with the thriller with this one.

Koontz draws upon the world of psychology and even history for this one, and that adds a bit of realism to it. On the last two pages is a reference table on some of the works on psychology, and so forth, that he used for research for it. And still it is a really good and really intense horror thriller, that also leans on the psychological side of things.",i-the-muso-1968,1h27v93,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h27v93/chills_in_the_night_dean_koontzs_night_chills/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h27v93/chills_in_the_night_dean_koontzs_night_chills/,2024-11-28 22:53:48,18,0.71,18,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h27v93

books,Griffin and Sabine,"Has anyone else read these books? They are so beautiful… They really impacted me a lot when I was growing up. 

Especially because for many years, I only had the first book! I actually had no idea it was a trilogy until a couple years ago…

If you’ve read the books, you can imagine how much darker the story would be if it just ended after the first one. I was maybe 7 or 8 when I first read it, and the &gt;!fight club-esque!&lt; nature of the ending was totally mind-blowing to me. It was absolutely the darkest thing I had ever read at that point, and it made me feel ways about stuff for a long time. It was sad, but also so profound and beautiful. 

When I found out there were two more books, I read them as soon as I could. I liked them too.. Honestly though, I kind of preferred the stark ending I had grown up with, where &gt;!It becomes clear that Griffin is a man descending into loneliness and depression, and that Sabine is a figment of his imagination. The last 2 letters, and the final post script note always gave me goosebumps.!&lt;

books,Lapvona by Otessa Moshfegh— what exactly IS Ina?,"**This post really isn’t about how grotesque the book is. It’s strange how enraged that aspect of the novel makes people, anyway. Just close the book. Stop reading it.***

Ina obviously has some sort of spiritual power. She’s lived longer than is humanly possible, especially in medieval times, and seemed to have only minor issues replacing her eyeballs with horse eyeballs. She is imbued with a power that I have not been able to determine the source of. She fits the bill of a “witch” character: a deep knowledge of flora &amp; fauna, a secluded home, public distrust.

My personal theory is that Ina is an agent of chaos in nature. I can’t tell if Satan himself is influencing her or what, but she was able to regain youth and lactation abilities by the end of the book. The stunt where she threatens Grigor’s life is hard to pin down, as it could be seen as an actual example of her powers or, more simply, just how persuasive she is with words.

What could she be, then, if not human? I doubt she is a human but am not convinced she’s the devil or a run-of-the-mill witch, either.

It was also fun to exist in a world where homophobia just didn't exist.

books,The Prince by Machiavelli is not Satire ,"I have heard a lot of people online claim that the Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is Satire, this couldn't be further from the truth. There are very few serious historians that make this claim. There are a few reasons that people arrive at this conclusion, the most serious of which is that the philosophy of the Prince clashes with his other writing like the Discourses. In the Prince Machiavelli writes a handbook for authoritarian nobles to gain and maintain power, while all his other writings indicate that he's a staunch republican. However, Machiavelli is a realist, democracy was a far-fetched dream in renaissance Italy, He prioritized stability and reunification above all else. 

“How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall.”

I can't help but feel that a lot of these claim arise from an inner desire to deny the realities outlined for the book or from discomfort with the amoral view it represents ""it must be satire"". Machiavelli backs all his claims with good reasoning, and the book was never meant to be published for a public audience, if it wasn't for his premature death we might've never read it. 

Another claim that frustrates me is that the Prince is only relevant within its context, Machiavelli makes a lot of broad philosophical claims about the nature of Power that apply in different context, it's more than just a manual for Princes.

books,Fear and Trembling- Kierkegaard gave me ANXIETY ,"Fear and Trembling shook me to my core.  I picked it up to grapple with the story of Abraham, which had always troubled me. It wasn’t so much an ethical dilemma in my view, WELL at least not in the Quranic version, where Abraham asks Ishmael for consent, and Ishmael accepts. While still unsettling, this portrayal felt less harrowing to me than the biblical account. My deeper concern, however, lay in the tension between human judgment and blind faith. Little did I know how unprepared for what Kierkegaard had to say.

Faith, Kierkegaard argued, is fundamentally irrational **a leap into the absurd**. That idea terrified me. How can one immerse oneself in faith if there’s no clear path to what to believe? And how can one discern what to believe in without reason? His vision of faith, unmoored from rationality, left me deeply unsettled. Even more chilling was the realization that faith, when wielded by brilliant minds, can justify unspeakable evils (I couldn’t help but think of the antagonists in 1984 and Fahrenheit 451).

As I read on, frustration grew. My brain hurt as I wrestled with ideas I couldn’t fully grasp, but perhaps that was Kierkegaard’s point: faith isn’t meant to be understood. Yet, somewhere in the tangle of his words, a glimmer of understanding emerged. Kierkegaard wasn’t dismissing reason. Instead, he argued that faith begins where reason reaches its limits. I looked inward and saw this dynamic within myself: reason and belief in the absurd somehow coexisting, each feeding the other.

Then came the concept of the “teleological suspension of the ethical”  and I hated it at first. It clashed violently with everything I believed, especially my conviction that ethics are immutable. The idea that morality could be set aside for a divine purpose felt like a betrayal of the very foundations of what it means to be human. But as much as I resisted it, Kierkegaard’s argument began to work its way into my thoughts, unsettling and transforming me.

It forced me to confront uncomfortable questions: Could there be situations where our human sense of morality isn’t the ultimate guide? Is there a higher purpose that transcends our limited understanding of right and wrong? I didn’t want to accept these ideas, yet they lingered, challenging my certainties. This concept didn’t destroy my belief in ethics but added complexity to it. It changed me by making me see the tension between the absolute and the relative, the divine and the human, and how faith demands that we navigate these contradictions without resolution.

By the time I finished the book, my brain was **fried**. I can’t help but think Fear and Trembling is a dangerous book. Taken the wrong way, Kierkegaard’s arguments could easily justify horrors. Misinterpretation isn’t just possible, it’s inevitable in the hands of the wrong reader.

books,"How Writers Create Stories From Elements: An Analysis of ""Feathers"" by Ray Carver","*This is my analysis of* Feathers *by Ray Carver. All page references are based off of* [*this*](https://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall10/157A/wp-content/uploads/Feathers-by-Raymond-Carver.pdf) *PDF (****note:*** ***there are spoilers below****).*

\--

I will always, until the end of my days, get *very* excited when learning about where stories come from. Thankfully I’m not the only one with this fetish: there are thousands of books, blogs, interviews, and Substacks dedicated to their genesis. What a relief! It means that one can explore hungrily, achieve gratification from finding patterns in data.

From my reading I’ve realized that stories tend to originate from the same place: a few, sometimes disparate, elements jostling together in the artist’s mind. They could be anything, really: a sentence overheard, a recurring memory, a melancholic location, a bewitching character, a ludicrous dinner, a piercing sound. But, to be of any value, these elements *must* conduct electricity; when they rub against each other, they *must* generate enough friction to spark a story. From there the narrative starts helping the writer: it spawns new components in his mind and helps him generate the rest of what the tale requires.

Artists elucidate this process in a million different ways, but they’re all talking about the same thing. Elena Ferrante, one of the few good modern writers (can you be considered modern if you were born in 1943?) [says](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6370/the-art-of-fiction-no-228-elena-ferrante) that her stories come from *fragments of memory*:

&gt;They might be separate and identifiable—childhood places, ­family members, schoolmates, insulting or tender voices, moments of great tension. And once you’ve found some sort of order, you start to narrate. But there’s ­almost always something that doesn’t work. It’s as if from those splinters of a possible narrative come equal yet opposing forces that need to emerge clearly and, at the same time, to sink farther into the depths.

In film, the great avant-garde arthouse director and screenwriter, David Lynch, traversed the same path to come up with the idea for [*Blue Velvet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)#Origin):

&gt;It was hearing Bobby Vinton’s version of the song that got things rolling. And then I started thinking about what it would be like, sneaking into a girl's room and watching her through the night. And while there I would see a clue to a murder mystery. Jeffrey finds an ear in a field as the clue. I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body - a hole into something else, like a ticket to another world.

Most pertinent of all, since the focus of this essay is *Feathers*, are the [words](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3059/the-art-of-fiction-no-76-raymond-carver) of the big lion legend Ray Carver:

&gt;None of my stories really *happened*, of course. But there's always something, some element, something said to me or that I witnessed, that may be the starting place. Here's an example: “That's the last Christmas you'll ever ruin for us!” I was drunk when I heard that, but I remembered it. And later, much later, when I was sober, using only that one line and other things I imagined, imagined so accurately that they could have happened, I made a story—“A Serious Talk.”

These words, for some mysterious reason, render a clear image in my mind: I see these artists walking around, going about their days—Ferrante at a cafe in Naples, Lynch at a diner in Los Angeles, Carver taking a walk in Syracuse—with a Black Magical Bag (BMB), invisible to all except them. After they finish a story the bag is completely depleted; for weeks after it may remain empty. But through experience, observation, imagination, and rumination, the writer starts filling it again. When it is heavy enough he forces the elements to play with each other—sometimes he finds that they do not react. He goes back to walking, reading, writing, imagining, seducing eighteen year-old girls, drinking four bottles of whiskey, eating five-grams of mushrooms—doing, well, you know, the work that makes artists great. And, eventually, it works. The right chemical combination starts sizzling. He smells it and sits down to write right away, keeping the bag at arm’s reach from his desk. Then the story takes off.

\#

Carver never spoke publicly about how he wrote *Feathers*, but let’s imagine that his bag commenced with Fran, Jack, Bud, and Olla. As he wrote and revised, the story itself kept generating new elements. One time he reached in to find a set of janky teeth. Another time it was an ugly baby. He kept placing these elements on a desk that was becoming stranger and more cluttered. Diligently, he welded them into a cohesive, scintillating narrative.

Though Carver is incredibly skilled with language, so much of the genius of *Feathers* lies in choosing the right mixture of elements from his BMB. Bud and Olla are simple, peaceful, affectionate, provincial. Even though their lives are messy, they are content with each other, their child, their bird. Even though their house is chaotic, its most prevalent feature is a sense of calm, similar to that which runs underneath the extreme surface-level discord of India. Conversely, Jack and Fran struggle with each other. The former is dreamy and romantic; the latter is uptight and agitated. They don’t have a child, they don’t want to have children—Carver never defines their relationship in terms of marriage or otherwise.

In the hands of a good writer, the contrast between these characters is bound to create a compelling result. That is, as long as he gets out of their way. Carver, of course, just does just that—he lets them run free—and the reader naturally discovers all sorts of fascinating divergences: Jack *takes* beauty (lusting over his girl’s long hair) whereas Bud *gives* beauty (fixing his wife’s teeth). Fran fights against the messy flow of life in nearly every scene whereas Olla moves with it (allowing the peacock into the house). The townspeople want to *control* whereas the provincial couple *accepts*:

&gt;It was an ugly baby. But, for all I know, I guess it didn’t matter that much to Bud and Olla. Or if it did, maybe they simply thought, So okay if it’s ugly. It’s our baby. And this is just a stage. Pretty soon there’ll be another stage. There is this stage and then there is the next stage. Things will be okay in the long run, once all the stages have been gone through. They might have thought something like that.

Another element in Carver’s BMB, which was at the center of last week’s [analysis](https://anthonymarigold.substack.com/p/feathers-by-ray-carver-pt-1), is the motif of *wishing*. Ray first employs it to represent Jack’s romanticism, display the couple’s hope for the future, and further the already-present feeling of nostalgia:

&gt;Those times together in the evening she’d brush her hair and we’d wish out loud for things we didn’t have. We wished for a new car, that’s one of the things we wished for. And we wished we could spend a couple of weeks in Canada.

On the next page, when Fran ignores Jack’s dreams of living in the country, the author reveals the distance between the couple (p. 6). Then—when everyone *except Fran* notices that Jack is praying at the dining table—the refrain increases the story’s wistfulness and the emotional gap between the two (p. 25). Finally, on the last page, *wishing* evokes a sense of tragedy when the two friends listlessly hope that things will get better for Jack, and that they could speak openly with each other (p. 26).

Even Fran’s long blonde hair, though terrifically simple, is another multi-dimensional element. Carver introduces it as a symbol of the couple’s bond, tied together by Jack’s lust (p. 3). Later, when the baby grabs it in the dining room, the author exercises its physical properties to build tension as we fear Fran will lash out at the kid, or the peacock will get a hold of it (p. 24). Then, when Fran cuts it at the end, he turns the hair back into a metaphor that signifies the end of the couple’s love and attraction (p. 26).

\#

Now it is time for the big daddy: the peacock. Originally, I hesitated to put this in because its meaning is more abstract, so please take the following with a grain of salt. All of this is, after all, only my interpretation.

With that in mind, I see the bird as a metaphor for how Jack and Fran experience their child, the one we never meet but the father describes as “conniving” (p. 26). Note that the peacock is first introduced in the same breath as a baby:

&gt;A baby’s swing-set stood in the front yard and some toys lay on the porch. I pulled up in front and stopped the car. It was then that we heard this awful squall. There was a baby in the house, right, but this cry was too loud for a baby.

Then they sit in the car, watching the animal, too gobsmacked by its awesome power to even refer to its beauty, an experience not dissimilar, perhaps, from that which parents experiences during childbirth:

&gt;“Goddamn it,” I said. I sat there with my hands on the wheel and stared at the thing.

&gt;“Can you believe it?” Fran said. “I never saw a real one before.”

&gt;We both knew it was a peacock, use, but we didn’t say the word out loud. We just watched it. The bird turned its head up in the air and made this harsh cry again.

This is one of the rare moments that moves the couple closer together:

&gt;“My God,” Fran said quietly. She moved her hand over to my knee.

&gt;“Goddamn,” I said. There was nothing else to say.

The only other one is at the end, when Olla gives Fran peacock feathers, the night she becomes pregnant:

&gt;And then my friend and his wife saying goodnight to us on the porch. Olla giving Fran some peacock feathers to take home. I remember all of us shaking hands, hugging each other, saying things. In the car, Fran sat close to me as we drove away. She kept her hand on my leg. We drove home like that from my friend’s house.

Right before she does, she uses language related to bird food, commonly referred to as *bird seed*:

&gt;“Honey, fill me up with your seed!”

And later, when she complains about how things are, she explicitly blames the peacock:

&gt;“Goddamn those people and their ugly baby,” Fran will say, for no apparent reason, while we’re watching TV late at night. “And that smelly bird,” she’ll say. “Christ, who needs it!”

Although they say earlier on in the story that they don’t want kids, they are moved together in the face of an astonishing, captivating, mystical force. To them, however, it turns out to be a trick. The kid, to a great extent, ruins their relationship.

\#

These elements are mind-blowing. They are versatile, powerful, comedic, *and* work well with each other. Carver’s invention and use of them is frightening because it is so brilliant.

It’s not only what Carver adds, however, that gives the story strength, but what he excludes. *Feathers* is incredibly dense—there isn’t a word wasted—and much of that comes from the author’s *merciless* commitment to cutting every element unessential to the tale. The story staunchly adheres to Chekhov’s famous rule: ""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.""

Every major element of the story—the teeth, the peacock, the two couples, etc— contribute tremendously to the plot; yet even minor details from early on in the story become relevant later on. Near the beginning of the tale, for example, the narrator relays the anecdote of hanging up on Olla because he forgot her name. Then, once he is at her house, he returns to it to add humor and create the relatable awkwardness that arises between couples that don’t know each other well:

&gt;I said, “Olla, I called here once. You answered the phone. But I hung up. I don’t know why I hung up.” I said that and then sipped my ale. I didn’t know why I’d brought it up now.

&gt;“I don’t remember,” Olla said. “When was that?”

&gt;“A while back.”

&gt;“I don’t remember,” she said and shook her head. She fingered the plaster teeth in her lap. She looked at the race and went back to rocking.

&gt;Fran turned her eyes to me. She drew lip under. But she didn’t say anything.

&gt;Bud said, “Well, what else is new?”

Because Carver abides by Chekhov’s Gun, the reader learns to expect that everything he introduces is significant. When the peacock enters the story and then goes away, the reader trusts that it will come back to give more to the narrative; when the baby is heard crying, the reader knows—before it ever appears—that it is guaranteed to be relevant.

In this way the reader learns to pay attention to even the smallest moments. He revels in finding foreshadowing. He feels at ease because he’s in the hands of a storyteller who can be trusted to connect all of the dots. Since every concept is important, he becomes more focused and, naturally, applies his attention.

\#

To thoroughly enjoy *Feathers*, you don’t need to think about any of this, of course. The story itself is inherently pleasurable. It takes you out of yourself; all that remains is unburdened emotion and narrative.

But, after looking under the hood, I’m in even greater awe of it. Carver took the most seemingly simple elements and mixed them to produce a profound story that can be appreciated on many different levels—a feat on-par with the Beatles writing the most original songs in history with four guitar chords.

By following Chekhov’s Gun, automatically, as if by a universal law, the number of Carver’s words and concepts decrease while the power and density of each multiplies. If the primary goal of a story is to move someone happily along to the end—instead of dragging them the way Joyce does—then it is essential to ask of each concept if it is relevant, to have the courage to cut it when the answer is maybe or no.

*Feathers* shows us that, if a writer can fill up his BMB with the right elements, and has the bravery to prune his stories ruthlessly, masterpieces are possible.

The book of his that I read was a selection of his writings, The Harz Journey and the like, and I didn't realize until I was reading it that I haven't had a good pick-me-up book in a while, though there were bits of ""Depressing Thoughts are Bad for You Health"" here are there, it was fun to read about a guy who refuses to let go of the wonders life does have to offer.  It kind of felt like I was reading The Poetics of Space again.  And I loved hos views on religion and philosophy, I felt very reassured by him saying that if you are to get into philosophy then you need some sense of humor, other wise you're going to go a little crazy.  Though I'm not sure if I'm going to read more of his since I feel like I got all that I need from this book, though I have felt that way about other writers and later when I did start reading another book I felt like an idiot for not reading is sooner.

books,Why watch an author interview?,"I've noticed that interviews with famous authors on Youtube get tens of thousand of views, while interviews with less-known authors often get a few hundred or less. (Popular writers are popular, duh!) But my sense is that the interviewers (and publicists and publishers) think that an interview can be a way for an author to attract new readers. I think this is mostly wrong. The main function of an interview is to provide readers with an extended experience of the novel. That is, we go find an interview with the author after we've finished their novel and we want to spend more time with it.

In other words, we don't need an overview of the plot. We don't need an interview that carefully avoids spoilers. Is that just me?

books,"""I don’t mind diversity, as long as it’s done well.""","Have you ever heard someone say this and just felt your blood pressure spike? On my soul it's so annoying. I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I realized this statement, despite how “neutral” or even progressive it sounds, is actually loaded with a ton of issues. 

Let’s talk about it . 

First of all, who decides what “done well even means? Nine times out of ten, when someone says this, they’re holding stories with diverse characters to some mythical higher standard. Like, a story can’t just exist with marginalized characters or perspectives—it has to prove itself. There’s an unspoken assumption that the presence of diversity of all kinds is inherently risky or unnatural or might drive away white readers; so the story has to work extra hard to justify its existence.

And when people say this, they’re also kind of ignoring the fact that stories with non-diverse casts don’t get the same scrutiny. Nobody is out here saying, “Well, I don’t mind stories with all-white, all-straight casts, but only if it’s done well.” Those stories are just allowed to exist. The assumption is that they’re the default, the baseline, and they don’t have to explain themselves. But if a story centers people of color, or queer folks, or disabled folks, suddenly the pitchforks come out. It’s like, “Well, why are they even here? Does this add to the plot?” Like, do you ask the same question when another gritty white dude with a dead wife gets a whole TV series?

What really gets me is when people claim they “don’t care about color at all, as long as the story is good.” That’s such a disingenuous statement. If you truly didn’t care about the identities of the characters, why is the diversity worth mentioning at all? The fact that you’re even bringing it up tells me it’s not as neutral to you as you’re pretending. It’s almost like they think they deserve a cookie for tolerating diversity, as long as it performs to their specific standards. It’s giving “I have a Black friend” energy, honestly.

Here’s the kicker: nobody makes these critiques of bad representation when it’s a group they see themselves in. Ever noticed how some the worst-written characters are often straight white dudes, but people still love them anyway? You’re telling me diversity has to be “done well” but you didn’t bat an eye when your favorite action hero couldn’t string together a coherent sentence and had all the personality of a wet sock. Or when the jaded smarmy self insert character only has snark and coffee going for them. 

What’s even more insidious about this whole mindset is how it pretends to be on the side of “good storytelling.” Like, people will say they’re against “forced diversity,” but what does that even mean? Why is diversity assumed to be artificial, but all-white casts just… natural? The problem isn’t the diversity. It’s that some people are so used to seeing stories centered on their experiences that anything outside of that feels wrong to them, even if they don’t realize it consciously.

There’s obviously some nuance to it. Like, let’s be real—context matters. If your story is set in, say, ancient Japan or medieval Iceland, no one’s expecting a wildly diverse cast. That’s fine. Authenticity to the setting is important, and it’s not about shoehorning diversity into places where it doesn’t make sense. But if your story is set in, say, modern-day New York City, a college campus, or even a sprawling futuristic metropolis, then yeah, we’re going to side-eye a lack of diversity. Those are spaces where people of all kinds coexist and have for a long time. So when creators act like the absence of diversity is just “natural” it feels more like a choice—a choice to ignore reality for the comfort of keeping certain audiences happy.

And that’s where the double standard really shows up. If a historical drama set in rural England has an all-white cast, it’s considered “accurate.” But if a fantasy world with dragons and magic includes Black characters or queer characters, suddenly it’s “politicalor “forced.” Make it make sense. The same people who demand historical accuracy in one breath will turn around and defend the complete erasure of diversity in contemporary or speculative settings where it absolutely belongs. You can’t have it both ways. 

At the end of the day, if you’re more likely to critique a story because it prominently features marginalized people, maybe you’re not as neutral about diversity as you think. And maybe, just maybe, the issue isn’t with how “well” the diversity is done—it’s with you. 

Anyway, rant over. I’d love to hear y’all’s thoughts. Have you run into this “I don’t mind diversity as long as it’s done well” argument, and how do you respond to it?

TL;DR:

The “I don’t mind diversity as long as it’s done well” argument is a thinly-veiled double standard. Diverse stories are held to higher scrutiny, while non-diverse ones are seen as the default and don’t need to “prove themselves.” Context matters—no one expects diversity in ancient Japan, but in places like modern NYC or speculative settings, the absence of diversity feels deliberate. People aren’t neutral about diversity if they’re critiquing it more harshly than the blandest white characters. The issue isn’t the diversity; it’s the biases of those making the argument.",IJustType,1h193zy,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h193zy/i_dont_mind_diversity_as_long_as_its_done_well/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h193zy/i_dont_mind_diversity_as_long_as_its_done_well/,2024-11-27 17:02:10,0,0.46,0,0,154,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h193zy
books,Ten year passing of P.D. James,"P.D. James (1920.08.20 - 2014.11.27) was considered by many to be the eminent British detective fiction author during her career. 

Since today marks the tenth year of her passing I felt the need to make this post. I hope you enjoy it. 

I recall watching an interview with her at the end of one of the many Masterpiece Theatre productions of her Adam Dalgliesh detective novels. She stated that when on vacation she would come across a town/city/ village that seemed an ideal location for a novel. Later she would return to the location for a longer visit writing down descriptions of interesting features of the location and  inhabitants to use in her next novel. I thought that it was a superb way to ground a work of fiction in reality. 

In 2008 she published the mystery novel ""The Private Patient"". I recall reading an interview in which she stated that it would be her last novel. She was afraid that it she continued writing at her advanced age the level of her work might drop off and disappoint her fans. I thought how sad to realize that after such a long career to realize it was time to quit. 

Imagine my surprise a few years later (2011) when I came across an advert for her new novel, ""Death Comes to Pemberly"". I immediately searched for an interview with her to explain this backtracking of her earlier declaration. She explained that she did previously believe she was done with writing. However she had long been a devotee of Jane Austen and had at one time considered writing a ""Pride and Prejudice"" sequel. She remarked that she discovered that her mind would not let her rest until the idea came to fruition. She realized that many Austenites would be upset with her for bringing death to Pemberly, but she stated ""it is what I do"". 

While reading ""Death Comes to Pemberly"" I realized that here was a novelist in her 90s that was still an excellent writer. Not only had she produced a remarkable ""Pride and Prejudice"" sequel, but that she had intentionally written it in the style of Austen. I can only hope that my own mind is still active enough in my 90s to be able to read such outstanding literature.",Knight1errant,1h16zfd,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h16zfd/ten_year_passing_of_pd_james/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1h16zfd/ten_year_passing_of_pd_james/,2024-11-27 15:32:20,37,0.88,37,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h16zfd
books,Cormac McCarthy love,"I was in a reading slump for several years and clawed my way out of it with some fun and engaging but not too challenging books like Hyperion by Dan Simmons and the Southern Reach books by Jeff Vandermeer. Great books, really fun, good pacing and easy to read. But nothing too heady or intellectually rigorous.  

Even still, after five years or more of only reading for work or reading news articles, my attention span was shot and I had to set mini goals to keep reading. Like I wouldn’t let myself stop until I read 5 pages, or until I got to the next page break, or the end of a chapter. As a voracious reader in my twenties and early 30s (I’m 43 now) I was shocked by how much difficulty I had finishing a chapter from a simple book. I DNF’d more books than I’d care to admit before getting back in the saddle, so to speak. 

Which brings me to this guy I had never heard of called Cormac McCarthy. Holy effing shit how did I live 43 years without hearing of this guy Cormac McCarthy. I picked up No Country for Old Men on a whim. I had watched the film over the summer when my wife and I went on a Coen brothers film spree. The movie was good, the book blew me away. The depiction of Anton, particularly toward the end of the novel, was one of the most chilling and engrossing things I’d ever read, and led to me significantly reorient my conception of the human experience. Wow! Blew me away. 

Since then I’ve read Outer Dark and All the Pretty Horses. Outer Dark was bleak as hell and not something I’d want to repeat, but All the Pretty Horses immediately became one of my favorite books of all time. The way this man could paint a picture in my brain is beyond impressive. I don’t understand at all his talent for words. I don’t know how a person can put a few sentences together in such a way that I can read them again and again and get more out of it every time. He accomplishes so much with no wasted words or thoughts. The meticulous care it must take to craft such a thing is not something I can understand, but I sure appreciate it as a reader. And the final scene… holy shit I probably read the last two pages a dozen times. 

I’m a few chapters into The Crossing right now and so far it’s also beautiful and highly evocative. I’m planning to finish this trilogy and then move onto The Road and Blood Meridian. I will probably read a few lighter books in amongst those, for the sake of my sanity. 

Anyway, just came here to say that Cormac McCarthy is a real good author and I’m glad I found his works. I know what to ask for for Christmas this year.

books,Do you sometimes wish you knew less about an author?,"Though sometimes I like to know more about an author, on average I would say I like to know less. I want the book to speak for itself. I'm talking about fiction here by the way.

In my experience, so often details about a fiction author are distracting or reduce my enjoyment of the book because they take me out of the world of the story and into reality. This is particularly the case if I really like the book. It's sort of like not wanting to see the sausage being made. Again, there are exceptions, but that's a general pattern I've noticed.

I do try to avoid information about an author's personal life but that's not always easy. Sometimes people tell me things. Other times it's all over the news. I mean think of the sexual allegations against Neil Gaiman.

Someone I was chatting with online told me that her father had recently learned that a favorite author of his had been many years ago quite vocal about their personal political beliefs and these beliefs happened to be very much opposite to his. Feeling terribly upset, her father threw out the books of the author, stories that had brought him comfort and joy for so many years and had nothing to do with politics. She thought that was crazy.

books,TIL Napoleon hated novels but secretly wrote his own edgy romance full of cuckoldry and emo vibes,"I recently spent an evening reading Clisson and Eugénie, a romantic novel written by Emperor Napoleon in his youth—a humorous and self-indulgent work penned during his early years. This piece offers an intriguing glimpse into the ""edgy teenage soul"" of a man who would later conquer Europe.



The Plot (Brace Yourself for Peak Napoleon)

The story revolves around Clisson, a genius born for the battlefield (ahem, self-insert alert), portrayed as cold yet kind-hearted. Through military achievements and undeniable charisma (sounds familiar?), he quickly ascends the ranks. But Clisson doesn’t just crave glory; he also yearns for idealized love. He meets the pure-hearted Eugénie, falls madly in love, and they vow eternal devotion before settling down for an idyllic countryside life.



Of course, fate intervenes. Duty to his homeland pulls Clisson away to war. While he wins victories on the battlefield, his domestic life crumbles spectacularly. Eugénie develops feelings for a ""nice-guy"" subordinate officer, turning Clisson into a tragic, heartbroken general in the middle of a war.



The pièce de résistance? Clisson’s emo spiral concludes with him meeting his end by letting ""thousands of merciless bullets pierce his body."" (Excuse me, how many? Thousands?) And thus, he dies as a ""noble and heroic"" figure. The tragic irony is that this melodramatic plot mirrored Napoleon’s real life—not once, but multiple times—as his relationships and two marriages fell apart due to infidelity. Turns out, ""cuckold literature"" might have been a subconscious prophecy.



Napoleon’s Teenage Energy, Encapsulated

Clisson and Eugénie is clearly Napoleon’s edgy self-insert novel. Clisson’s every trait—from his military brilliance to his unwavering passion—seems like the young Napoleon slapping on labels he wished for himself. The overly idealized romance reeks of a ""sexually frustrated teenage fantasy"" from a man who hadn’t yet figured out love.



But credit where it’s due—Napoleon later achieved things most fictional heroes could only dream of. He might have been bad at writing novels, but he was extraordinary at living like one.



""The Emperor of Edginess""

Let’s be real: Napoleon’s literary talent was... lacking. His writing is clunky, awkward, and reads like a disjointed diary entry. Some passages are so cringe-worthy they’d make middle-school fanfic look polished. Perhaps his disdain for novels—dismissing them as ""servants' reading material unworthy of a real man""—stemmed from his own struggles as a failed novelist. Sour grapes much?



Ironically, this same young Napoleon read Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther—a quintessential romantic tragedy—seven times and still found time to criticize Werther for committing suicide. Imagine the scene: Napoleon, now ruler of Europe, debating plot points with Goethe himself. When Napoleon boldly proclaimed, ""Werther should never have killed himself,"" Goethe could only respond, ""Perhaps novels don’t need endings.""



From Cringe to Charm: Why We Love Napoleon

This is where Napoleon’s charm lies: imagining yourself as an impossibly perfect hero is cringeworthy, but actually becoming that hero? That’s emperor material.



(At this point, I can’t help but marvel: Napoleon’s novel was painfully bad, but somehow, even the cuckoldry became real. Is this man’s life a cosmic inside joke?)



A Hypothetical Twist of Fate

If Napoleon had married Désirée and settled in a countryside château with a lovely garden (as hinted at in his letters), the Napoleon we know today might never have existed. And we have Désirée’s brother—who demanded too high a dowry—to thank for that twist of destiny. Life is a blend of blessings and curses; you never know what’s waiting just around the corner.



(Also, starting to suspect Napoleon had a thing for unfaithful wives—his obsession with the charming and flirtatious Josephine was definitely a choice.)



Bonus Embarrassment: Talleyrand’s Reading Session

As a final jab, picture Talleyrand, Napoleon’s wily advisor, reading Clisson and Eugénie aloud in front of the emperor himself. Napoleon’s toes probably curled so hard they could’ve carved the Tuileries Palace into the floor.

books,"Making Sense of People, by Samuel Barondes (2012)","A thought-provoking book, for sure.  I had a few complaints, I had a few surprisingly good reactions to parts of it.  Surprising to me, anyway!!  I’ll start with the complaints and finish up with the flattery.  Overall:  I plan to buy a copy for myself, not something that happens often.  But in this case, it seems essential.

Just to set the scene:  the book is about who we are, who the people around us are, what we need to know about one another and how to organize that information.  What the so called science of psychology can tell us about that project, as we all develop it in our unique and different ways.  How to evaluate people properly.

I should probably add that I bring a no doubt unique perspective to the struggle, having over the decades of my life evolved my own particular view of people, that is to say individuals and societies, and how to organize what I know about them.  People are crazy, just for example; all people.  There are no exceptions.  For another example, the personality, in my view, does not in any sense reflect who we “really” are, whatever that may be.  Rather the personality is a two-way control interface, a biological Jacob’s Ladder, passing requests and demands back and forth between whatever’s out there and whatever’s in there.  “We” – our personalities – are largely tangential to that ongoing process, and only rarely is either what’s out there or what’s in there actually addressing “us” in that sense.  There normally isn’t much point, as it is what’s in there that actually makes the big decisions, in my view.

There’s more, I’m sure you’re interested – could I bore for England, is the perennial question -- but the point is:  I had a unique view of the personality already, before I picked up the book.  Hopefully knowing that will allow you to season my conclusions appropriately for your own use.

So.  Complaints.  Some apparent dishonesty, some apparent evasiveness.  And he seems to think that many if not most of us acquire “complete pictures” of one person or another, and that we can use his schema to arrange our knowledge of that person.  To organize it properly.  This strikes me as remarkably optimistic, for a man who has lived in the world upwards of 50 years, as I’m sure he has. Does he know someone – anyone – well enough to apply his own schema to them?  Do any of us?  I find it hard to imagine.  I don’t think I have a good enough view of my own parents to do that.

By dishonesty what I mean is, he makes it very clear that there’s no scientifically defensible consensus as to what constitutes character.  And then he accepts his own conclusions about that as fact, for the remainder of the discussion, without further inquiry or explanation.  It’s a rhetorical trick we find a great deal in the social sciences, and one that seems to rely on Authority as the decisive factor in an attempt to persuade the reader.  When (oddly enough) it’s the basis of that Authority that is actually in question, and in need of defense.  To those who have training in critical thinking, I mean.  Many, I’m sure, will say to themselves, well, the guy is a professor at UCSF, he must know what he’s talking about.  When in fact he tells us almost as directly as possible that he actually does NOT know what he’s talking about.  And so it’s an ancient and objectionable (at least to me) way of finessing that ideological lacuna.

Maybe dishonesty is too strong a word.  Maybe.

And by evasiveness I mean he skips over the link between traits and character, even if we assume his definition of character is good, rather blithely, as though courage were clearly reducible to some combination of the big 5 character traits, or of his suggested list of their different facets. 

And while I’m on that subject, his list of different facets of the big 5 has precisely six facets for each trait.  To me, this falls in the category of things that make you go “hmmm.”  I’m not saying it’s evasive; but it looks suspiciously preordained.  One suspects that some psychological borders have been aggressively edged, to get the list down (or up) to the magical number.

There’s more, but that’s enough for now.  That should be enough to give anyone a healthy skepticism. 

So what’s good about the book?  Why am I going to buy a copy?

First, the idea that character is traits evaluated, or that traits are character devalued, is a very interesting one, and one I want to hold on to.  Now, he didn’t come up with the idea himself; but it is central to his thinking about people and who they are, and it’s a very sensible notion.  It improves my own schema, the one I had before I read the book, by a lot.  It fills in a rather blank gap.

Second, the idea that we can move from traits to character to universal principles of behavior is likewise very interesting.  I don’t think it’s true; but it’s not a bad starting place.  A first offer, so to speak, in negotiation.

His careful explanation of the links between the traits and their various facets is, I think, excellent.  It’s a list I want a copy of.

His references are of the best, at least as far as I can tell.  I haven’t read widely in psychology, but I know the names:  Funder, Bandura, Block, Buss, de Waal, et cetera et cetera.  And others more famous, of course, like Allport and Darwin and Erikson, but that first list are people who have done good work much more recently, and so it lends the book some assurance (at least to me) that the author is not a lone nut.  And he also and in addition supplies professional references for quite a few ideas that I really did want good references for.  Which makes the book even more useful, of course.

And finally, the idea that the questions you ask someone can be very revealing of their character, and that there is a list of really good questions – questions I wouldn’t have thought of myself -- which we might build up and take note of the answers to, is I think excellent.  It expands the borders of possibility, for understanding people.

So overall:  well done.  Not our final answer, not even close:  but a good and a firm guidepost.  I don’t think this one will have to be moved very far, if we ever come to a certain knowledge of what people are.

books,Just finished The Twisted Ones by T. Kingfisher. I feel 50-50 on this one,"Spoilers for those who haven’t read this book yet. 

I just finished the book and I didn’t like it but I didn’t hate it either. I started reading it thinking it was this good horror book but then it dove into fantasy?…idek what I was expecting but it wasn’t this. The overall story was good but I had a few gripes with it. 

1. Mouse’s breakup with her boyfriend was completely irrelevant and should have cut it out. I completely forgot about it until it was brought up again when she was at the coffee shop. Like I get adding backstories but this wasn’t needed. 

2. What was up with phone call to the secret society/ the weird people who were at the funeral? The weird people at the funeral kept getting brought up but it didn’t add much to the story. The dad already said it was a closed casket and that Cotgrave died outside so she could have put the “big twist” together without having the hint from the guy on the phone. 

3. This is a gripe that I have with all authors. Adding characters towards the end of a book just to kill them off because they were only added to keep the story moving. 

4. Why not have her find the Green book? It would have explained so much because everything that Mouse was going off of was the speculation of an old man losing it. 

5. The ending felt lazy. And most of the explanations fell flat for me. All of the build up just for that. 

I’ve read some of the authors other books and I really liked them but this isn’t one I can say I liked. I did enjoy the overall story but when I read the descriptions I thought I was getting this mystery horror book but it wasn’t that at all. The only thing that could be considered scary was the deer in the tree before it went down the fantasy path. Also, how the fuck did that deer get in the tree? Did Anna put it there? Someone with thumbs had to put it there. Or did it float in place or use magic since magic apparently works in both worlds?

books,Just finished Lonesome Dove. I loved it. I’m sad I’m done. Here are some of my interpretations of things. How did you interpret this things?,"1. Lonesome Dove name. It’s the name of the town, but isn’t it all if us? All the characters were lonesome doves. Even if they were in love with someone or with groups of people, they couldn’t fully connect.

2. The real love story was Gus and Call. Not in a romantic way, but in each other they found home and purpose. They were each other’s person.

3. Gus sent Call back to Lonesome Dove to give him one last purpose and adventure. He knew he’d need it

4. Names. Seems pretty important. Call couldn’t say Maggie’s name nor give Newts his. They asked Deets to come up with a first name, but didn’t call him by it. Most had nicknames. Why was this such a relevant theme?

5. The last line. Why that line? Again, didn’t use the name Lorena, but just whore. Why? 

6. Did Po know all that might happen?

books,The Grey Wolf by Louise Penny,"This’ll be full of spoilers so stop now if you don’t want to hear it. 

I just finished *The Grey Wolf* by Louise Penny, the 19th book in the Inspector Gamache series. 

I’ve got a lot of problems with this book and you people are gonna hear about them. 

General complaint - every time Penny strays from Three Pines, the series suffers. 

Plot complaint - this is at least the third time that Penny has used the same plot. Oh no, Inspector Gamache has to fight a far reaching plot involving corruption at the highest level of the Sureté!  Again.  Oh no, he’s betrayed by one of his oldest must trusted friends!  Again. At this rate Gamache has proven to be one of the worst judges of character who has ever lived.  

The addition of a massive terrorist plot raises the stakes, a totally unbelievable one. Sorry, I just don’t find it credible that multiple government officials would work with the mob to murder hundreds of thousands of their own residents. 

Most of the book is taken up with unraveling a ridiculous chain of hints and riddles. We are supposed to believe that several sane adults would, learning of a massive terrorist plot, leave a bunch of vague clues instead of just opening their mouths and flapping their tongues. Why tell Gamache what’s going on when you can break into his home, hide a note in his jacket, no 2 notes, meet with him and drop hints in an assumed accent, and then leave an obscure liquor in a B&amp;B near his weekend home?

Guns on mantelpieces in first act did not go off by third act:

Why was the mob sub-plot even in this book?  It was breadcrumbed from the beginning but could have been left out entirely.  Penny even details all the reasons why it’s ridiculous because mobsters would rather make money than commit mass murder. More than once. 

What was the deal with the boss at ABQ?

Open questions:

Brother Robert supposedly idolized Dom Philippe - but there was no room in Robert’s life story for them to ever have met before. 

Why did Paolo Parisi kill Charles?  We’re just supposed to take at face value a completely unsupported guess that he was working for the mob to rebel against his family?

Why was Dom Philippe connected with Paolo at all?  They had breakfast together every morning for two weeks for no plot-related reason?

Why was Dom Philippe an asshole thirty years ago to his niece?  Because Penny needed a reason for them to be estranged, apparently. 

Why was the traitor Sebastien instead of Irene?  Irene would have been much more interesting and she was explicitly described as 2nd generation Italian. If it had been her, she could have tied in the mob subplot and Robert’s murder would make more sense, since it happened right after her arrival at the monastery. 

‘Letter B’ - give me a fucking break. It’s fine as a code between two people who sang that song together but an outside guessing this meaning is not believable. And I say this as a parent. 

Ridiculous coincidences:

Dom Philippe is a mentor to a key figure in the plot. 

Dom Philippe is the uncle of the staff member of the treacherous politician. 

Dom Philippe just happens to have breakfast every day for two weeks in a homeless shelter with a mob peon/hit man. 

Dom Philippe just happens to land at the homeless shelter where key figures investigating the plot are, after failing to elicit a confession from someone completely connected in another country about the same plot. 

The mob peon just happens to crash at this same homeless shelter. 

The newspaper just happens to print a recipe for a cocktail using chartreuse just in time for it to be used as wrapping paper for Gamache’s jacket AND be used by Dom Philippe in Three Pines. A cocktail called ‘The Last Word’. For most of the book I was expecting the food editor at the paper to be involved, or for ‘the last word’ or something to be relevant. It wasn’t. 

And then an ending promising further depths to the plot. Unfortunately given the above my suspension of disbelief has crashed to the ground. I’m a regular reader of murder mysteries and I’m perfectly willing to entertain coincidences and leaps of logic but this is just too much.  There were too many characters carrying the stupid ball at once. 

Perhaps Dom Philippe is a criminal mastermind. Or the woman running the shelter. I probably won’t be finding out. 

The new audiobook reader was fine.

books,Potentially hot take: Jazz is my favorite work by Toni Morrison ,"Up until recently finishing Jazz, I would have said the objectively best Toni Morrison was Beloved and my personal favorite was Song of Solomon. Now I think Jazz may take both of those categories. Here’s why:

1. This is the most innovative work by Morrison formally. The obvious formal parallel is jazz music, as the writing is meant to reflect the newly found freedom and raw emotion of the jazz age. But I would also draw a huge parallel to Faulkner, especially Light in August. The very disjointed, almost jarring switches in narrative, the intensely lyrical interludes, and the use of incredibly heavy recurring symbolism felt very reminiscent of the way that book was structured. 
2. The number of complex, nuanced racial themes touched upon within ~225 pages is staggering. You have the legacy of slavery (obviously) but also more subtle discussions of colorism and interracial identity along with the overarching theme of the opportunity and alienation that resulted from the very rapid shift from countryside to city in the African American community of that time. The ideal of breaking with slavery’s legacy and achieving unprecedented independence in the city is balanced with the breakdown in traditional values and the overall sense of alienation that came with urban life. Moreover, the urban transplants (Joe and Violet) can’t escape their upbringings through moving, and the traumas of rural southern life are still there; they just manifest differently in the urban landscape.
3. The ending (I don’t want to put spoilers so just trust me on that) 
4. The characters are highly complex, the narrators can be both highly sympathetic and highly unreliable, and every character is somehow tied together. One of the biggest criticisms I see about this book is how disjointed it is, but I found it remarkable how basically all of the Virginia characters and Harlem characters related. It was actually a pretty meticulously developed plot that just developed nonlinearly. The recurring symbols also gave it a sort of grounding/unity.

Of course, this is all just my opinion. I really think all Morrison books are great and would be curious if anyone else agrees/disagrees.

books,Just finished City of Illusions by Ursula K Le Guin. Oh my god. I get it now. I'm hooked.,"Someone gave me a copy of ""The Dispossessed"" years ago. Its been sitting on my shelf for years. I havent read it because I found out it's part of this 'Hainish Cycle' and felt like I wanted to read it in order. It just felt like a big commitment that I never got around to. Kept letting other books cut in queue. Well...I finally got to it with the 3 volume novel. It has Rocannon's World, Planet of Exile, and City of Illusions.

I got to book three thinking, eh, yea these are pretty good. I like'em enough to keep going. But then getting to the last half of book three, everything started clicking. I gotta say, I am so damn happy that I didnt take the advice of some and allow them to just be standalone. I get how they are, but Rocannon's World and Planet of Exile both go up a star rating after I finished City of Illusions. I loooove the intertwining and the way Le Guin is telling these stories.

books,How do you feel about Call Me By Your Name?,"How do you feel about this book? I've heard so many great things about it, but I'm finding it extremely boring! I'm halfway through the second part, and while there are some beautifully evocative passages, the book is mostly pining from a precocious teen. It feels more obssesive than it does romantic at this point, as well. 

The character of Oliver, too, isn't working for me. We keep being told how everyone falls at his feet because he's so charming, but he's really not. He's kinda bland, honestly.

I think I'll finish it anyway. It's an easy enough read and the lenguage IS quite beautiful. But how do you feel about it? Is the hype deserved?",Real-Music4441,1gzdnpz,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gzdnpz/how_do_you_feel_about_call_me_by_your_name/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gzdnpz/how_do_you_feel_about_call_me_by_your_name/,2024-11-25 07:44:06,63,0.8,63,0,85,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gzdnpz
books,A character you disliked at first but came to like later? Or vice versa?,"It's funny when you read Pride and Prejudice and find yourself feeling the same way the narrator does: Disliking Mr. Darcy for being arrogant and standoffish in the beginning, and then gradually coming to like him as you learn more about him indirectly through others but also eventually directly.

But I've also had experiences where I did not feel the way the narrator or author appeared to feel toward a character. And sometimes these feelings changed over the course of the book.

I may be the only one who feels this way about the much hated Javert, for instance, from Les Miserables. I wouldn't say I came to like him but by the end but by then (and I won't say what happens) I saw his internal torture and outward sign of that suffering, which to me finally made him human.

books,I'm raising an Awful-Awful to Ruth Doan MacDougall. The Snowy series is ending. ,"I like a lot of [Ruth Doan Macdougall](https://www.ruthdoanmacdougall.com)'s books, but I'm especially a fan of the Snowy series. The ninth installment, **Off Shore**, has been released. I have it on my Kindle, but I'm going to put off reading it until 2025, at least. Maybe after I turn a year older. Because this is also the final book, and like RotK, Deathly Hallows and so forth, I can only read it for the first time once. 

For anyone who's not familiar with the Snowy series, which is probably all of you, it started in 1973 with **The Cheerleader**. It's a young woman's coming of age in New Hampshire in 1955 - 57; it's called The Cheerleader for the same reason Sloan Wilson called his novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. Stock character, wearing a uniform, but inside that uniform is an individual. MacDougall is so good at making a place seem real, like you can feel and taste it. And Snowy (Henrietta Snow) is not a stock rah-rah girl, and the other characters are well-drawn. This is not a novelization of Happy Days, ya dig? It's heartbreaking in spots, and the ending is maybe not what you'd expect. It was an instant favorite of mine, when I read it in my late teens at the turn of the '90s.

([What is an Awful-Awful, you ask? ](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/lifestyle/food/2023/06/12/newport-creamerys-awful-awful-is-a-ri-classic-heres-how-it-was-named/70303695007/)The link is from Rhode Island while Snowy is in New Hampshire, but it's generally a New England thing.)  

MacDougall got enough fan interest in The Cheerleader that she wrote a sequel around that same time. **Snowy** covered the next thirty years, freshman year of college to 1987. A lot of her friend group, ""The Gang"" appear in it as well. Then there was **Henrietta Snow**, which brought the characters to 1999. That one's a slog; I think it would have done better as a collection of short stories. In the 2000s, Snowy's friend Bev was the POV character in **The Husband Bench**, and another friend, Puddles (Jean; they were big on nicknames in those days) was the focus of **A Born Maniac**. Then back to Snowy with **A Gunthwaite Girl** and **Site Fidelity**. Bev again in **Lazy Beds**, and the new one is Snowy alternating POVs with Puddles. Nine books, except that Gunthwaite Girl is a novella, so maybe 8.5. 

Well, I've followed these people, who are younger than my parents but close to the age of my in-laws, for thirty-five years of my time, and over fifty years of theirs. I knew it had to end, and honestly, I'm glad MacDougall is ending it on her own terms. If I'm sad about anything, it's because I don't know of any other Snowy fans I can discuss this with. Anybody mind if I come back sometime to share my review, when I do read it?

books,"When reading Wicked, I found myself really wanting a story about the Wizard’s rise to power as ruler of Oz","The story on the whole is really fucking weird and imbued with a weird sexual energy that reminds me of Ron Howard’s live action adaptation of The Grinch.

That being said, Gregory Maguire succeeds in making the Wizard of Oz this ever-present, suffocating force that hangs over almost the entire story, with the exception of the beginning at least, and transforms him from a bumbling fool into a figure of real menace and power. 

It’s never fully revealed to the audience how or why the wizard came to Oz. In spits and spatters here and there we come to learn that it was via magic in an ancient tome that he somehow gained possession of. We learn some really terrible things about him too but in those brief glimpses Maguire shows just how much ambition and ruthlessness the Wizard had to have in order to even cross over to Oz let alone begin the process of taking it over.

books,History through a novel,"I am reading ""Loot"" by Tania James, set around the last Maharaja in India to defeat Britain's East India Company in battle before being overcome, and more specifically around a creation called Tipu's Tiger. I am reading it because Tipu was mentioned in a podcast (""Empire"") about the East Indian Company which made me curious for more.

Loot is really well written and detailed without getting bogged down (which is hard to do). It has made me appreciate the way a novel can flesh out understanding of a historical period even when it's not a ""historical novel"" like something by Ken Follet, where detailing history is at least as important as telling characters' stories.

books,"Trapped in ice: Dean Koontz's ""Icebound"".","So another Dean Koontz finished tonight!

""Icebound"" is set in the Arctic icefields where a team of scientists are setting up explosives that are set to explode at midnight, in a strange and urgent experiment. But before they could return to the safety of their base camp, a massive tidal wave has broke loose the ice they are standing on.

They are now completely marooned on an iceberg while a winter storm rages all around them. And worse, the bombs they planted cannot be retrieved, and they are still ticking. And there is also a killer among their number who has is own mission.

""Icebound"" leans heavily into the adventure-suspense side of things. Of which I enjoyed with great relish! Koontz's suspense novels are equally as good as his horror novels. I've enjoyed ""The Face of Fear"" and now I've thoroughly enjoyed ""Icebound""!

Interesting thing though, ""Icebound"" is a reworked version of a novel that Koontz published in 1976 under an alias with the original title of ""Prison of Ice"". That 1976 version had been for a long while until Koontz, after being urged by many fans to re-issue some of his earlier books, had it re-issued with the story being updated in the 90s.

Now I love to read a good book every now and then but I have a really hard time getting invested in most books I read tbh. This book is different tho. I am heavily invested in this story already and I really haven’t even been reading it for long. It’s so damn good that I can’t put it down.

The same goes for asking for books with unexpected twists. Then you’ll be looking for a big twist…but if it’s from a genre known for twists (such as thriller) perhaps it doesn’t matter.

I’m just curious about questions such as these. There’s nothing wrong with them, but doesn’t that spoil the book for a person, and I would imagine especially with the former, requesting an unreliable narrator?

books,Why do so many people think they can write better than published authors?,"This is a bit of a random rant. Something I see all the time, especially online, really irks me: people claiming they can write better than [insert popular author here]. It’s usually directed towards bestselling writers or someone whose book is trending, and the comments are always along the lines of—“I could write better than this in my sleep.”, etc

Here’s the thing: no, you probably can’t. I’ve read writing on platforms like Wattpad, and even the best stuff is often… not great. Writing something readable isn’t that easy. Even experienced writers struggle to turn out something consistently good, let alone something worth publishing. And that’s not even getting into the editing, pacing, character development, and narrative arcs that make a book actually readable.

As someone who writes for fun, I get how you can write a chapter and think, “Wow, I could totally do this!” Writing a single chapter or an essay for some course you’re taking is easy. Now try writing 50 more, setting the right pace without dragging or rushing, ensuring the characters develop in a way that makes sense, avoiding repetitive scenes or dialogue, and tying all your plot threads together in a satisfying way. It’s a creative exercise I enjoy, but it’s also exhausting—and I don’t even publish my work! The arrogance of thinking you can casually outdo authors who have slogged through all of that to bring a full story to life is just wild to me.

books,Non-fiction books that spoil the events in the introduction,"This might sound a little stupid, in a ""I didn't know Titanic was a real ship"" kind of way. But I hope it makes sense.


This year I've done my best to read several non-fiction books and I've had a good time with them. They've been excellent and memorable. Among others I've read:


Into Thin Air


K2


Under the banner of heaven


The Wager



They were all very good, but all 3 of these come with a big flaw. They all say what is going to happen, in the introduction. 


I wasn't familiar with any of the events of any of these books when I started reading them. I have a habit of not reading blurbs or other marketing material, so besides knowing that The Wager is about a ship or Into Thin Air is about Mt. Everest, I go in blind. 


And yet part of the entire story is told in the first page or 2, when I personally couldn't see any point in doing so. The Wager was particularly bad about this as it really told most of the ""twists"" of the events immediately, when it could've been skipped.

books,S. A. Crosby's Razorblade Tears,"I just finished S. A. Cosby's *Razorblade Tears* and really enjoyed it!

It's about two violently flawed, but loving fathers coming to terms with how they mistreated their gay sons, and working together to seek vengeance on the people who murdered their sons. I was hesitant to start it because I thought it would be trauma porn, but I'm really glad I read it. While there is a lot of trauma and a lot of grief, the characters accept the mistakes as the past they can't fix, and focuses on the problems they can fix in the present. There's this constant forward momentum to the book that makes it very engaging, and almost hopeful.

The book is not without fault. While I absolutely, completely, unreservedly, 100% agree with Cosby's views on systematic racism,  class privilege, and the mistreatment of people in the LGBTQ+ community, he is heavy handed with the message, sometimes to the point of breaking the narrative's flow. Though, I don't blame him for feeling like he really has to spell it out. He also loves to write in metaphors and similes and some are quite cringe. The foreshadowing is kind of obvious. Some of the character's motivation seems a bit convenient... 

While it's not the best written book I've read this year, it is one of the most enjoyable. It feels kind of wrong to say that a book about some very heavy topics is enjoyable, but I burned through it very quickly because I was reading it every chance I got. While the who and the why was kind of obvious, the stakes got raised so high that I was really curious how, or if, they were going to return back to a normal life after everything that happened.

If you've read it, what did you think of the book?

books,All The Pretty Horses,"So I earlier this year I started to read Cormac McCarthy, starting with The Orchard Keeper. I wanted to read his books in order of publication, and so far for me, every book is better than the last. 

I loved Suttree, and when read Blood Meridian twice and took a break from McCarthy, thinking that it didn't get much better than Blood Meridian. Truly a remarkable fucking book, but I've been trying to read All the Pretty Horses for about a little bit, but I couldn't get very fat each time I tried. I figured I was a little McCarthied out, so took a break from reading altogether. 

Now this week I started All The Pretty Horses again, and my God do I get it. It sang to me, and I can't stop reading it. I can see why it won a pullitzer because wow there's just something about it that draws me in.  

Today I was thinking and figured out what it was. It's got that feel of Suttree, all my favourite things about Sutree mixed with the beautiful prose of Blood Meridian. Feels like a combination of the two and it's quite a beautiful thing.

I don't know if this book is discussed much here I always see Blood Meridian posts, but just wondering what other people think of this one and even the trilogy as a whole because I don't know much about it, just been going into each book kind of blind and really didn't think it got any better than Blood Meridian until ATPH.",jimmysprunt,1gxmnz1,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gxmnz1/all_the_pretty_horses/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gxmnz1/all_the_pretty_horses/,2024-11-23 00:19:25,79,0.87,79,0,39,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gxmnz1
books,"I liked China Miéville's ""Perdido Street Station""","This book interested me because it falls under Steampunk (although there is more Biopunk here), and I like this direction of science fiction. In the end, I liked it. 

Let's start with the world of this book. The book takes place in the fictional world of Bas-Lag, or rather in the city of New Crobuzon. There are many areas with different creatures, from ordinary vodyanoi to cactus people.  

If looking at the book you think: ""Why is it so huge?"" Then here's the answer: The author likes to talk about his world. I'm serious, China can spend a page describing the life of some area and who lives there, who has what religion. And that makes the world alive. 

The author also has a very rich imagination. Khepri, for example, are creatures with a human body and an insect instead of a head. Or redone? This is a real Cronenberg body horror. 

Now about the plot.  

Scientist Isaac receives an unusual client, namely a Garuda without wings, because he committed some terrible crime, which is why they were cut off to him, and he asks to return them back. And this request will soon turn into a huge disaster for the entire New Crobuzon. Khepri, Lin, Isaac's girlfriend, also sculpts a sculpture for a violent mobster in secret from him. 

The plot here feels both small and enough. Like, the whole story with moths begins in the second half, and the first describes the relationship between Isaac and Lin, about their friend Derkhan, about Isaac's work with the concept of flight and Lin's work as a sculptor. 

In short, the plot is quite decent. There were a lot of tense scenes, especially in the second half.

Characters are boring, except for one. Isaac is uninteresting, as is Derkhan. These are just people who got into, to put it mildly, an unpleasant situation. Lin is a straight character from the category: ""Lost potential"". She has an interesting backstory, she looks interesting too, but she has the most boring storyline here. Yagharek is also interesting only for his appearance and crime. I'll praise for the crime the author chose. There's no way to justify it. I consider a huge psychotic spider to be an interesting character here. Because this is a huge psychotic spider. 

The author's writing style is very good. The book is written atmospherically, you are directly immersed in this fabulous, but dirty and dishonest world. The text itself is easy to read.  

As a result, there is quite a decent plot here. It's not boring, but there's nothing super-outstanding about it. Characters turned out to be boring, except a spider. The writing style is very good here. But I think this book is not about the plot and characters, but about the world, because most of the book is just about New Crobuzon. About who lives in it, how creatures of different species get along with each other, what powers they have, what certain parts of the street look like, the history of this world. And you still want to know more about him.",mystery5009,1gxicxr,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gxicxr/i_liked_china_miévilles_perdido_street_station/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gxicxr/i_liked_china_miévilles_perdido_street_station/,2024-11-22 21:05:32,110,0.89,110,0,42,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gxicxr

books,Expanding a trilogy.,"I saw something today, and thought I’d share.

I read “The Lewis Trilogy” by Peter May a while ago, and I really enjoyed it. Today, while browsing Amazon for my next read, I was recommended Book Four of the series! 

I think “The Lewis Trilogy” is May’s most successful work, so in a way I understand he would want to explore those characters some more. But why didn't he just start a new series instead of stretching the original trilogy? Plus just the whole “Book Four in The Lewis Trilogy” is kind of ridiculous. Sounds like a parody to be honest. 

Has anyone else encountered this before? Is it something that authors do? I'm genuinely curious about your experiences with authors who ""expand"" their initial trilogies or duologies. Was it a good move? I have to admit, it's a first for me. This particular story was finished, concluded, why not leave it as it is? I’ll still read it (maybe), but I’m not happy about it. 

Maybe it feels weird to me because the books actually use the name “The Lewis Trilogy”. So it sounds final. 

The fourth book is called “The Black Loch”.",rmnc-5,1gx7q5z,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gx7q5z/expanding_a_trilogy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gx7q5z/expanding_a_trilogy/,2024-11-22 13:22:44,23,0.76,23,0,23,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gx7q5z

books,Why Lonesome Dove Deserves its Legendary Reputation,"Sometimes, a book's reputation precedes it so much that you wonder if it can ever live up to the hype. For me, *Lonesome Dove* not only lived up to my expectations—it far exceeded them.

I bought the book ages ago but kept putting off reading it. Finally, after finishing *All the Pretty Horses* for the second time, I decided to dive in. I was on a serious Western kick, but I worried *Lonesome Dove* might feel lesser by comparison. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The two books are incomparable. While they both fall under the Western genre, comparing them feels like a disservice. They're just too different.

This book is a true epic, and I mean that in every sense of the word. It gave me the same sweeping, awe-inspiring feelings I had while reading Ken Follett’s *The Pillars of the Earth* and *World Without End*. The scale is immense, the storytelling masterful, and the world so vivid it feels like you’re travelling every dusty mile alongside the characters.

# The Writing: Breathtaking in Its Simplicity

Larry McMurtry’s writing style is completely different from, say, Cormac McCarthy’s, but it’s flawless in its way. Where McCarthy leans toward sparse, poetic prose, McMurtry crafts vivid, almost painterly scenes. His descriptions are breathtaking and memorable.

Some images from the book have lodged themselves firmly in my mind. One of my favourites is the old hermit with his mounds of buffalo bones—a haunting symbol of changing times. Another unforgettable scene is the cattle in a St. Elmo’s firestorm, their horns lit by lightning as they journey north. McMurtry’s ability to capture such moments in stunning detail is one of the book’s greatest strengths.

# The Characters: Perfectly Realized

The cast of characters in *Lonesome Dove* is nothing short of perfection. Despite its sprawling narrative and large ensemble, every character—major or minor—feels fully realized. Their drives, struggles, and triumphs are so authentic that they practically leap off the page.

What I found remarkable is how McMurtry makes you care equally for each storyline. Every character is flawed but layered with unique, redeeming qualities that make them unforgettable. It’s this balance of humanity and imperfection that brings the story to life.

# A Story Both Dark and Romanticized

*Lonesome Dove* captures the stark reality of life in the Old West while romanticizing it just enough to feel timeless. The danger is palpable—death seems to lurk around every corner of the journey from Texas to Montana. And yet, there’s also an undeniable beauty to McMurtry’s vision of the West: a land of endless peace and sparse grandeur, where the hardships only heighten the triumphs.

It’s a tragic story in many ways, marking the end of an era and the fading of the Old West as an idea and ideology. The tone is dark but not overwhelmingly so, always grounded in a sense of truth.

# Why You Should Read Lonesome Dove

If you’re hesitating because of the book’s length, don’t. The journey is absolutely worth it. McMurtry keeps the story fresh with changing scenery, a steady pace, and characters who draw you in completely.

I understand now why *Lonesome Dove* won the Pulitzer Prize and is so highly regarded. It’s beautiful, heartbreaking, and satisfying from start to finish. It’s an unforgettable journey with expertly crafted characters, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.

# Where to Go From Here

This was my first Larry McMurtry book, but it certainly won’t be my last. How do his other books compare? I know there are other books in the *Lonesome Dove* series, but I’m also curious about his other works. If you’ve read anything else by McMurtry, what would you recommend? Are his other novels as good as this one? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

For now, I might take a short break from traditional Westerns, though I recently started *Outer Dark* by McCarthy. While it’s not a Western in the traditional sense, it has a rugged, frontier-like atmosphere and a dark, haunting quality that fits the genre in its own way. But Larry McMurtry has definitely got my attention.

# Final Thoughts

In short, *Lonesome Dove* is epic beyond belief. I wish there were a better way to describe it, but that’s truly the best word: *epic*. If you haven’t read it, I can’t recommend it enough. It’s a time investment, but one that pays off in every way. This is a book that will stay with me forever, and I couldn’t be happier to have finally read it.

books,Thoughts on MW Craven's Washington Poe series?,"No spoilers, at least not intentionally. I like to read but I'm not an expert or a critic, just got to musing about this.

Just finished the fourth of the series, and it got me thinking.  The structure and overall plot was ""fine"", intricate, surprising, twisty/turny.  But, looking back at my notes-to-self on Goodreads:

\#1 - five stars; loved the characters, graphic crime details, story arc, and wrapup.

\#2 - five stars again; returning to familiar characters and setting, but fleshing it out with a grisly mystery that wound all over the place without quite crossing into implausibility.

\#3 - three stars; the overarching plot device (though apparently real per the endnotes) didn't get enough attention and the whodunit was frankly pretty implausible.  Structure and characters still fun, but fell quite short.

\#4 - three stars here too.  What got me, and the reason for my post, was the almost mechanical structure to the plot.  Not quite a deus ex machina / Chekov's gun overload, but seemed like a puzzle that every piece fit too neatly.  Though it was an interesting read, there was very little in the way of distraction or development of the returning characters &gt;!even Poe's house as a recurring theme was used as a plot piece, which I found overwrought!&lt;.  Also missed the grittiness of it.  Yes there's violence and murder, but it was pretty deep background, particularly when compared to #1.

So, this is what got me thinking (dangerous at the best of times) - do you suppose I'm looking for more meat on the bones?  IE more Agatha Christie nattering over scones (for worldbuilding and red herrings)?  Or maybe the lack of in-your-face horror is the missing flavor?  Just curious, I suppose, since Goodreads likes them all about the same.

I've always been drawn to books about culture clash and subtler treatment of privilege and neocolonialism, and this had all that in spades. I also like books where there's a single, shocking incident that ties the entire plot together. There was a really interesting and nuanced mix of characters who all offered different perspectives on the main themes, and the writing and pacing were fantastic - there are some books you have to remind yourself you're reading, and others where you look forward to getting a spare moment so you can read some more of it.

books,Ask Not: The Kennedys and the Women They Destroyed by Maureen Callahan,"Marking this as a spoiler even though it is non-fiction. 

**If you read this, how did it change your perception of the Kennedys?** 

I grew up in the 70s/80s. I remember people asking (not me obviously) ""Where were you when JFK was shot?"" My parents weren't Kennedy-stans, so I didn't hear a lot about them growing up. 

Before reading this book, here were my opinions/thoughts/conspiracies about the Kennedys. 

1. Joe Sr. was an absolute asshole who was obsessed with having one of his sons becoming president. He was pro-Nazi. He forced one his children to have a lobotomy and then hid her away. 

2. JFK was a womanizer and may have had something to with Marilyn Monroe's death. He was on drugs to help him with back pain and to stay alert and awake. 

3. JFK, Jr. was the wonderchild and wasn't it a shame that he died so tragically. 

4. RFK was the future of America and wasn't it a shame he was assassinated. He was such a good guy! 

5. RFK Jr. is a weirdo, but come on, his dad was assassinated. Doesn't mean he should be president though. 

6. Ted is guilty of manslaughter. 

According to Callahan, the Kennedys were so much worse. 

But more than just ""the Kennedy men were awful"" - she shows how the women in the family were not necessarily saints either. But she makes it clear that it is not an excuse for how the men treated the women in the family. That is what made the book for me. Showing the women as they were and not making them out to be perfect victims. In fact she says ""There is no perfect victim."" 

I came out of this ready to dismantle the illusion of JFK, RFK and their sons. All around terrible people. It also makes me question nature vs nurture in the Kennedy family. 

**Have you ever read a non-fiction book that caused you to change your mind about a person/family/event?** 

One more note about the book - it flows very well. It's not chronological and it doesn't focus on one woman at a time. There are good stopping points when you need a mental cleanse from all the disgust and anger.

books,Selling Out the Spectrum: A Thoughtful and Balanced Perspective,"I decided to pick up ***Selling Out the Spectrum*** out of a deep interest in autism and the important questions it raises—not just about the daily lives of individuals living with this condition but also about its broader impact on families and society as a whole. Autism is a topic that demands sensitivity, understanding, and a willingness to explore complex layers of human behavior and interaction. This book immediately stood out to me for its thoughtful and well-rounded exploration of these challenges and dynamics.

From the very first pages, the author impressed me with their thorough analysis and nuanced perspective. What truly sets this work apart is the way it balances a personal viewpoint with an admirable openness to opposing perspectives. Rather than pushing a single narrative, the book fosters constructive debate, encouraging readers to engage with a variety of viewpoints. This approach informs and challenges readers to reflect, making the book an intellectually and emotionally engaging read.

One of the book's strongest qualities is its ability to humanize autism, weaving in relatable scenarios and real-world applications that help contextualize its analysis. It avoids clinical detachment and instead emphasizes empathy, creating a connection with the reader that feels both genuine and impactful.

That said, the book is not without its flaws. While the biographical section offers insight into the author's connection to the subject, it feels less compelling than the rest of the text. It lacks the depth and focus present in the analytical sections, which might leave some readers feeling a slight disconnect.

Despite this shortcoming, the book remains an excellent resource for anyone interested in understanding autism on a deeper level. It serves as a great starting point for those who want to delve further into the subject, whether through additional research or personal reflection. More importantly, it invites dialogue and positions itself as a foundation for meaningful conversations about this complex and fascinating topic.

Highly recommended for readers who wish to approach the topic of autism with an open mind and a broad perspective. Whether you're new to the subject or already familiar with it, this book offers valuable insights that will stay with you long after you’ve turned the final page.",inabookhole,1gwkdme,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gwkdme/selling_out_the_spectrum_a_thoughtful_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gwkdme/selling_out_the_spectrum_a_thoughtful_and/,2024-11-21 17:09:59,11,0.72,11,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gwkdme

books,"5 Broken Blades, absolutely abysmal but with potential.","This book sucked, horrendously. It told instead of showed, filled with plot holes. You saw the twists from a mile away or not at all, because there was no foreshadowing.  The characters feel flat, the characters realise things slower than they should, they all are just drama queens who trauma dump within the first 30 so pages of their introduction, it’s just horrendous. 

But I say it has potential, why? Well the plot is actually very intriguing. There’s a plot to kill the King of Yusan who has this McGuffin which keeps him alive which needs to be removed, on top of that there 4 other McGuffins which sort of revolve around the plot and come in and out. The plot ends on something of a cliffhanger, the next book will undoubtedly be a direct sequel. If Mai Corland (the author) can fix her writing style she will have such a good book on her hands, make the characters unique beyond their back story and traits, make the plot twists something you can predict but with effort, think through your characters and McGuffins to avoid plot holes. 

The next book releases next year and I do believe it can be great, so if you’re willing to pick up a 430 page book that isn’t the greatest book I recommend it.",J360222,1gwd6jj,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gwd6jj/5_broken_blades_absolutely_abysmal_but_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gwd6jj/5_broken_blades_absolutely_abysmal_but_with/,2024-11-21 10:25:23,5,0.73,5,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gwd6jj
books,I need to went about ”a little life.” SPOILERS,"Okay. Where to begin? The book is well written in so that it’s easy to read and you can get through chapters cuite quickly. And the prose (if that’s the correct term, I’m not a native english speaker) is beautiful enough to keep me invested in the slower parts of the book. 

HOWEVER there are things that made me loathe the book after I finished it. And here’s where we get to spoilers, so be warned. Here’s what I hated in the end:

- The book is basically on the verge of torture porn. Jude just keeps hurting himself to the point of me losing all my sympathy for the character. And I don’t just mean physical abuse. People are constantly ready to help him and he doesn’t do anything. He even refuses painkillers. I’m sorry but I find it hard to believe someone would be so goddamn stubborn in every possible way. And there really wasn’t ANY character that was nice to him before he was like 15 years old? Every man in his life wanted to abuse or rape him? Heavy handed if ypu ask me. 
- I hated that Jude and Willem became a couple. For the whole book I was so happy that finally there’s a loving platonic portrayal of two male friends, without the usual ”dude energy.” But of course they had to get romantically together so that Jude can not enjoy sex once more. 
- What kept me interested in the book was seeing Jude finally accepting help and getting even somewhat better. And we get it in the second to last chapter when he i agrees to therapy willingly. That would have been a beautiful ending after all of the shit we’ve been through with Jude, BUT NO!!!! Miss Yanagihara wants to torture his character and us simultaneously and we got that final shit chapter where Jude kills himself in such a blink and you’ll miss it way that I felt cheated. 
- What mostly ruined the book for me was when I noticed that Yanagihara introduced important character moments almost exlusively in past tense. When Jude and Willem are already 45-50 years old they suddenly do something that the author tells us they have done always, but there was no mention of it at the start of the book. Felt kind of like she had a great idea when she was already 700 pages deep in writing and didn’t want to rewrite anything. After I realized that I enjoyed the book much less. 
- As a final fuck you to the reader, everyone else dies except Harold, Julia, and JB who is arguably the worst of the main characters as a person. And he even gets the house where Jude and Willem loved eachother? Come on!! 

This turned me off from reading any of Yanagihara’s other books for the time being. When I finished, I threw the book across the room. 

Thank you if you read this far. I don’t recommend you to read this book.

books,None of this is true - spoilers,"Okay I know it's not a new book but I just finished ""none of this is true"" by Lisa Jewell and want to talk about it!

First off I had the audio book which was amazing! The format of the book worked so well with audio book that I honestly can't imagine actually reading it. The cast did a great job too, especially the one little part from Brookes mother. It made the whole thing feel so real, like I was going to hear about Josie on the news. 

Secondly and most importantly... WTF. Who do you believe? I know the title but what is true?! Like part of me believes Josie but the thing that makes it hardest for me is the way they found Walter and Erin. Josie just kind of writes it off as ""after that I didn't remember what happened"" and paints herself as a victim (of course, it's her whole MO) where as Erin's side makes more sense to how they were found but she colors Walter so angelic. Also can't remember if it was Erin or Roxy but one of them says Walter skyped with his sons in Canada secretly but the one part from the son says he hasn't spoken to Walter since he was a child and moved. I kind of wonder if Brooke was Roxy and Walter/Erin were Josie? A friend who read it said they didn't believe anything from Josie because of what the girls and Pat said about her but I've seen bitter nasty abusers absolutely trash people with lies before, things similar to what we're said about Josie. So for me that casts doubt on their testimonies. She denies all of it but fesses up to Nathan. I don't know, I'm rambling at this point.

books,Why I feel lost reading the later dune books,"Spoilers for the series up to maybe 50% of god emperor of dune

Also remember that this is just my opinion. You are allowed to enjoy the books and there is nothing wrong with it. This is just my experience. 

1. dune goes through many accepting periods throughout the series. There are events that take place that make you say “why????” But you just have to accept them if you want to enjoy the story that comes next. It happens with Paul dying, with Leto fusing with the sand trout, and Leto fusing with the worm. I sometimes fall into this camp. I just wonder, “from a writing perspective, when frank herbert sat down to write the book, what made him think turning the main character into a worm is a good idea?” 

2. This is sort of similar to my previous point but anything after dune messiah is so unexpected that it just feels out of place. If the events that in any other story, I think most people would be fine, but because it happened in dune, it can be a little jarring. I gave a similar example in a previous post. I think it fits in terms of plot but just in the feel of it. I apologize for it being crude. Imagine you’re watching a movie about a bullfighter. The whole movie, you watch the bullfighter struggle against the bull. But he sucks at his job. Audiences are getting bored. So one day, the bullfighter decides he must undergo physical changes to fight the bull. But instead of taking steroids or something like that, he shoots bull sperm into his veins and turns into a bull human hybrid that the crowd loves. That is what it’s like essentially when jumping from dune messiah to children of dune and god emperor. 

3. the stakes drastically decrease. Don’t get me wrong, the larger stakes in the context of the story are huge. But the moment to moment stakes feel so redundant. It goes from “our entire family is being attacked and we are stranded on a desert planet. How will we survive?” To “our worm god is getting attacked by random thugs so the best army in the world has to kill these very unskilled fighters. Will they accomplish it?”

4. Unnecessary plot threads. So many plot threads get dropped between books that you wonder why they were even included. Farad’n had no impact on the story. And him getting BG training is even more useless since he doesn’t even use it and isn’t in the next book. The whole thing with jacurutu existing. Why does this random outpost of bandits matter? What makes jacurutu specifically matter? When Leto goes through the spice trance, why is harum so important? Why is he even included if he’s only mentioned once or twice in throwaway lines but somehow has the importance of a possession? It feels irritating reading 500 pages and 200 of those are just unnecessary things you will never see again or had any impact on the story. 

5. The characters make dumb decisions. Wensicia really thought in children of dune that she could kill the two children of the most revered emperor in mankind’s history, who also had the power to see the future, with two tigers. And that is what half of the book revolves around. 

6. the dialogue just tanks in quality with each book. In book one, it was clunky at best. In messiah, it was an irritation. In children it was unintelligible. And it gets better in god emperor but it is still probably some of the stiffest dialogue out there. 

Also the fact that there’s a long homophobic rant in god emperor about how if an army is composed of all men, they will turn gay then turn into rapists when they leave the military ",Feisty-Treacle3451,1gw4vte,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gw4vte/why_i_feel_lost_reading_the_later_dune_books/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gw4vte/why_i_feel_lost_reading_the_later_dune_books/,2024-11-21 01:55:09,63,0.71,63,0,126,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gw4vte

books,James by Percival Everette,"I just finished James by Percival Everette and I thought it was really good. There are definitely quite a few variations from Huckleberry Finn, but mostly the changes I would say are good for the story he’s telling. I think it definitely reads more like literary fiction as compared to the original adventure story that Huckleberry Finn was to me. I think Jim (or James) is comparable to how I imagine Frederick Douglass was based on his narrative.

I think there’s much more satire in Huckleberry Finn toward religion and the institution of slavery. So, I think the new adaptation is more on the nose of the issues, but I think it was still really great. Considering Twain was intentionally writing an entertaining story and Everette was more focused on writing something that would look back in retrospect to the perspectives of slaves like Frederick Douglass, I think the changes are justified. 

The big difference between the two novels is the sense of adventure is somewhat lost in James compared to Huck Finn, but they’re two different books with two different aims, so I was expecting the book to be different. I’m surprised it didn’t win the booker prize, but I’m sure the winner is a good book as well.

books,Ishiguro et al.,"I'm currently reading Klara and the Sun, and I can't shake off the feeling that the narrator is like a good diligent schoolgirl relating in the first person the content of someone else's diary. I don't deny it might be appropriate given the context, although it's a bit frustrating when you see that the narrator declares pretty early she is writing from much later on in the story, and still it comes across so naive and unaffective.

But then I thought of Never let me go, which I DnF'd a couple years ago, and though I can't be sure I remember it correctly the tone seems very similar.

So one question is: are all his books like this? I'm thinking in particular of The Remains of the Day, which would be my next attempt.

Another question: this kind of detached, good-boy voice quality reminded me also of, say, Earthlings. Or, thinking back to a couple decades ago and less traumatic stuff, Banana Yoshimoto.

books,"Can't believe I'm saying this, but the show was better...","Drawn in by the absolute masterpiece the Netflix show was, I went chasing the terrifying world in the book, **The Haunting of Hill house** by Shirley Jackson that inspired it 

As a fanatical, (sometimes infatuated) reader, I never thought I'd say the words; ""the show was better than the book"" 

My apologies to those who liked the book, because this rant is armed on a poisoned tipped spear 

*The good*


Spooky atmosphere and setting. I did not find this book particularly frightening, but it did a good job building a scary ambiance. An inanimate protagonist, the house, is a refreshing idea that sparks imagination 

*The bad*


Outdated and dull. The writing definitely showed its age in sentence structure and vocabulary. (But hey I learned new words. *Biddy* and *Bosomy*) 

Did I mention it was not scary? It read more like an itinerary than a horror plot. ""we walked through a place and it was cold"" kind of thing. ""We saw a statue with a mean face"". 

*The ugly*


~~terrible~~ Abysmal character development. With the exception of Mrs Dudley, the lack of interesting characters ruined this piece of literature. Everyone's personalty seemed over-simplistic, over-dramatic and down right cartoony. 


I'm convinced Disney got inspiration from Mrs Montague to write Cinderella's lady Tremaine. 

Did anyone catch how inconceivable the first character introductions were? Theodora and Eleanor's first meeting came straight out of a ages 3+ book. Bundled ""yay we're besties"" and ""let's go on a picnic"" 

Luke Sanderson? Ahh let's greet and treat him with sarcasm because he's opened up his house to us in full hospitality 

Let's get into: 

*The ridiculous*


Scare reactions. Who- pardon my french- the fuck laughs when they're being haunted? Who the fuck Cracks sarcastic jokes when there is a ghost knocking your door at 3am and you're feeling the chill of terror? Who giggles when you've just held a spectral hand?

Theodora and Eleanor do! 

It's hard to take a horror book seriously when there's a ""-Theodora laughed"" at the end of a sentence. These 30 something year old women were at times written like midddle-schoolers and at other times like divorced 50 somethings 

I am fully aware of the argument, ""the house made em act like that"" but if the characters weren't afraid, why should I as the reader be? 

Just because a book helped influencing an entire horror genre, doesn't mean the book itself is good. I was yearning, HOPING, Shirley Jackson was going to turn things around in the last chapter... but no. She crashed it 😉

books,Some thoughts about immersing a reader in a foreign culture,"I've been reading two book series this summer/autumn, both fantasy, both Japan inspired.

First: I hardly know anything about Japan but I'm fascinated by different cultures which is part of the reason I wanted to read these even though it's fantasy and not literally Japanese culture.

Anyway, the two authors have completely different approaches to immersing the teaser in the culture. One uses Japanese words all the time and has a little dictionary on the back. The other uses as good as no Japanese words, only their translations, takes the way that society works and thinks for granted and simply throws the reader into it with zero explanation. I believe both attempt to immerse the reader in the culture but the latter is far more successful in doing so, even though some translations may be imperfect. The constant use of Japanese words seems a bit show off-y to me and having to look up stuff all the time didn't really allow me to get immersed in the story. 

No idea what my goal is with this post, I simply wanted to share these observations.

books,"Yes, Y'all Are Wrong About Ayn Rand","Ayn Rand is a talented writer and the most fair criticisms of her work boil down to being derivative of Nietzche and verbose.

Although she's famous as a writer my favorite thing from her isn't novel but an interview where she talks about her husband. Rand was married to a struggling painter and the primary bread winner in her household. The interviewer asked if that was hypocritical. If she wasn't as selfish as she claimed. Her response was the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

She said her marriage was the most selfish thing in her life. That she gets several times more happiness from being married to her husband than to the world's richest industrialist. How a selfless marriage would truly be a sad thing. Who could imagine standing at the altar and saying ""I don't really get much out of marrying you. It's not in my self interest, but I'll marry you for your sake."" No. Your marriage should be a selfish affair. You should be getting something out of it that you can't live without. Something that you need so deeply that you'd sacrifice anything else. It wasn't hypocritical to pay for his painting because it *made her happy.*


And she is a talented writer. You just can't look at Anthem or Howard Roark's introduction in The Fountainhead as piece of craft and come to the conclusion that she wasn't.

You can admit that without becoming a libertarian or whatever. It didn't make me one, and in fact you *should* make good faith engagements with ideas you disagree with. 

But, If her work truly keyed in on one thing it's the pettiness of group think. She doesn't get derided so mercilessly today because she's an unappreciated ubermensch, but it is due to the social license to do so. Her work just doesn't merit the frothing hatred. But you sure can get up votes on reddit by being unnecessarily cruel about her.

A group of people one day found the town of Snowfield, California, seemingly just abandoned. But they soon find the first body, completely swollen and still warm. 150 were soon found dead, while 350 are still missing.

At one point they believed it was the work of a single maniac. Then they thought it was terrorists. And then thought it was Toxic contamination, and then a strange new disease.

Only then do they discover the truth and seen it with their own eyes. And what they saw was worse than anything they could've ever imagined.

It always feels good to be reading a familiar author after a long while! And it feels even better after reading a pretty good slowburner, and that's what I got with ""Phantoms"". Just one moment of suspense after another! And it's the kind of suspense that can have you on edge!

""Phantoms"" is probably the most Lovecraftian that Koontz ever got. It really does have that feel to it, in some ways. The best way I can describe it is as a Lovecraftian that is very much grounded. But this is a really good novel no matter how you slice it.

A disappointing, overhyped book, which offers no real insight into inequality, finance, nor the economy","[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188543465-the-trading-game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188543465-the-trading-game)

  
Gary Stevenson grew up in a very deprived part of London, then became a trader at Citibank. This is his story.

  
The book doesn't live up to the hype. The beginning is interesting, as it is the story of a poor kid, growing up near the financial district of Canary Wharf, who manages to land a job as a trader at a top American bank. After he starts his job, however, the narration quickly goes downhill.

  
Some praise Stevenson (who also has a youtube channel) as if he provided unique, profound insights into inequality, economics and finance. In my view, he does not; he rants about the economy being a zero-sum game (if you get richer someone else must get poorer) and about economists being out of touch (hardly very original thoughts), but doesn't offer any practical insight or solution.

  
The impression I got, which I found disturbing, was that the author was descending into a spiral of mental health issue of which he was and probably remains unaware, otherwise he would have described it differently; e.g. he goes to live in a flat without furnishing it, and other stuff I'd rather not get into to avoid spoiling the book.

  
Also worth mentioning that the Financial Times ran a story debunking many of his claims: [https://archive.is/DguLm](https://archive.is/DguLm)

books,"I don't think I've ever been so blown away by a reveal as I was finishing ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" by Agatha Christie","I just need a place to gush about this. I finished it last night, absolutely floored. I just lie there in bed reeling. I cannot fathom the genius of Agatha Christie. I can't write much without spoiling anything, and this is a book to be read knowing nothing, but I am truly amazed. 

I'm on a mission to read every single Agatha Christie novel. I started with *The Mysterious Affair at Styles* and was instantly hooked.

I know the best selling novelist of all time doesn't need advertising, but seriously, if you love mysteries and crazy twists (that actually make sense) and mysteries you absolutely *can* solve (but probably won't), you owe it to yourself to read Christie.

My only regret is reading her so late in life. I should have been done with her whole canon in my teens or twenties.

books,"What are some ""Achievement Unlocked"" books?","By which I mean: books where once you've got to the end you feel like you've earned a trophy of sorts, either because of the difficulty, sheer length, or any other reason.

I'm going to suggest the Complete Works Of Shakespeare is an obvious one.

Joyce arguably has at least two. You feel like you've earned one at the end of Ulysses, but then Finnegans Wake still lies ahead as the ultra-hard mode achievement.

books,The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant - Stephen R Donaldson - 1977-2013,"Has anyone else read this series?  I just finished all 10 volumes (2 trilogies and a tetralogy), and I find myself thinking about it often.

The worldbuilding is superb, the action is well written, the supporting characters are loveable, and the main characters are, for the most part, severely *un*likeable. I would categorize this series as somewhere between dark fantasy and grimdark, with extreme suffering endured by the protagonists, few uplifting moments, but somehow an overall hopeful message. I must say I have read few stories that better exemplify the concept of ""snatching victory from the jaws of defeat"" better than these books.

I might also add that I think this series would be next to impossible to adapt into a film series due to something that happens early in the first book.  This event led me to put this series down for close to 20 years before attempting a re-read. 

I haven't seen much discussion of this series.

books,"Thoughts on the ""It Was All A Dream"" Twist?","I recently finished a book series (for anyone who is curious, it's the &gt;!Pegasus series by Kate O'Hearn!&lt;), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though it's technically geared towards children (and I'm in graduate school), I loved the characters and the way the author combined the real world with Roman mythology. Now, the series consists of six books, and there were so many instances where I had to force myself to stop and get some sleep because I had been glued to the pages. In other words, **I was completely lost in the world the author had built**...and then, I get to the last couple of chapters in the final book. The second-to-last chapter *ends* with what easily *could* be the main character's death.

Now, while I would have been sad if the main character had died, it would have honestly been preferable to the way the last chapter *starts* \- with the main character's *waking up and finding herself in her apartment as if the entire series hadn't actually happened*! Her internal thoughts are *all about the dream she just had but couldn't quite remember*! I read that and was just TICKED OFF - thinking ""was this *entire* series **really just a dream the main character had**!?"" Granted, it is quickly revealed that the main character is only having this ""twist"" dream sequence because she is essentially in a kind of limbo between life and death. The chapter (and the series) ends with her *actually* waking up, seeing her closest friend (the one she made in the first book and **the one who kickstarted the adventures**), and feeling excited for any adventures to come.

Even though this series ***thankfully*** didn't follow through with the ""it was all a dream"" twist, my reaction to the fact that it was **teased in the first place** made me realize *just how much I hate this kind of twist*. It just feels like a huge let-down after spending so much time with fun characters and an amazing world. Now, because the ""twist"" wasn't really a twist, I will not be surprised if I find myself reading this series again. However, if the series really had been a dream for the main character, I don't think I'd be able to pick up the series again.

What about y'all? Whenever a series ends with ""it was all a dream"" (or something to that effect), how do y'all feel?",Crazy_Book_Worm2022,1gtstm8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtstm8/thoughts_on_the_it_was_all_a_dream_twist/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtstm8/thoughts_on_the_it_was_all_a_dream_twist/,2024-11-18 01:04:52,79,0.78,79,0,360,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtstm8
books,i finally finished “frankenstein” and i’m mad at myself ,"it’s ironic that the book i was supposed to finish in high school (almost TEN years ago) and dnf’d three times in the last 2 years, not only ended up being 4.25 ⭐️ but also being book 100 for 2024. wow.

i was the kid growing up who read every single book in all of their classes—even the ones that weren’t required. but “frankenstein” was that ONE book i just decided to skip. i used sparksnotes for my exam too 😭😭 god, forgive me for my sins 😭

it’s also funny to me because i actually had never made it past the first letter/chapter. it had always failed to capture my attention. i don’t know what happened this time around but i decided to give it another shot. i’m so glad i did. though in hindsight, i think it was “the phantom of the opera” that put me in the PERFECT mood to try out “frankenstein” again.

i’m a sucker for gothic literature. now i see why this is the most recommended one. the writing was superb, suspenseful and just vivid. it captured the feelings of creator and creation so perfectly. i was not expecting this much depth on philosophy, on life, creation, etc. and the fact that the writing style was so approachable was just the cherry on top!

the first third of the book is largely written in a series of letters from walton to his sister. then, the narrative shifts (kind of like a story within a story) and victor frankenstein begins telling us the reader about his background. there was so much suspense there. 

the 2nd third was mostly from the monster’s perspective (so a story within a story within a story 💀). but i didn’t particularly care for this section. i feel like it put the brakes on the pacing of the story. there wasn’t any suspense. while i appreciate the fact that we got to understand the monster more, i just feel like it interrupted the flow of the story. it was very abrupt. this is also where the writing became more clunky and convoluted. it is the section that made me knock down the rating to 4.25 ⭐️ 

what i loved the most about this style of narration is that each character (walton, frankenstein, the monster) had their own voice. everyone could stand on their own. no one sounded the same. it was a better experience than the characters in “dracula” (which i still loved), who kinda all sounded the exact same. 

so this is a lesson to all the folks who didn’t read the books they were supposed to for school—read that book now. who knows? you might be missing out 🤷🏾‍♀️",trailofglitter_,1gtpntf,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtpntf/i_finally_finished_frankenstein_and_im_mad_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtpntf/i_finally_finished_frankenstein_and_im_mad_at/,2024-11-17 22:34:07,172,0.82,172,0,62,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtpntf

books,"*The Ministry for the Future* by Kim Stanley Robinson, *The Deluge* by Stephen Markley, *Termination Shock* by Neil Stephenson","Just wanted someplace to collect my thoughts after reading these three climate tomes, and see what others thought.

* The Ministry for the Future -
This book was the most comprehensive and least simple to read, and at 576 pages (21 hours audiobook), surprisingly the shortest. The plot is little more than a pastiche for the science, and the science goes deep, even devoting one chapter to the point-of-view of a carbon atom. It starts with a climate catastrophe in India, which spurs the country to take on a geoengineering product spraying sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere to spur climate cooling. People form geoterrorist organizations as the greater geopolitical organization handling climate change does little but lip service. It ends hopefully, perhaps overly so, as people begin emptying out 2/3 of the habitable land for ""rewilding"" and peacefully putter about in sail-driven airships. This was my favorite  of the three books because KSR introduced and explained ideas (some with more success than others) like carbon capture coins, glacier meltwater pumping, and social media privacy.

* The Deluge -
This book focused a lot more on the social aspects of tackling climate change, and was very US-centric. It's significantly longer than either of the other two books, and although it stuck closer to its plot, it was a *slog*. I preferred both of the other books, which I felt focused more heavily on scientific than political developments, if only because the political developments felt so speculative, where scientific developments feel more grounded. This book also featured a geoterrorist organization bent on kneecapping the fossil fuel industry, and went very in-depth into the working and personalities of that group. Markley was very anti-geoengineering, however, unlike the other two books, focusing much more on the economic impacts of different movements. This book was devoid of all hope and I sort of hated it for that, and I also hated it for its anti-geoengineering standpoint.  A policy/political wonk might enjoy this book the most, however.

* Termination Shock -
A middle ground, both in length and in what it attempts to tackle, this might be the easiest read. Even if most of the action takes place in the US, it's more global than *The Deluge*, with one main character from The Netherlands and another a Canadian fighting in the Punjab, and more focused on the science, also promoting geoengineering through cloud seeding with sulphur dioxide. I appreciated that Stephenson took a major part of the book to look at the effects of that engineering, both positive and negative, rather than dismissing it outright like Markley. It's plot is more consistent than *Ministry* as well, although it's correspondingly less ambitious in its scientific endeavors, and less ambitious in its socio-political predictions than *Deluge*.

Overall, my favorite was hands-down *Ministry*. KSR took the time to look at twenty or so different techniques for combating climate change, but didn't try and say the path would be easy.

If you've read the three, what were your impressions, and what other books, if any, do you think tackle the climate crisis more thoroughly or more believably?",littlebugs,1gtnlav,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtnlav/the_ministry_for_the_future_by_kim_stanley/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtnlav/the_ministry_for_the_future_by_kim_stanley/,2024-11-17 21:02:53,70,0.92,70,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtnlav

books,Review of 100 Years of Solitude,"So I just finished 100 Years of Solitude, and I don't know how to put into words my review. I read it in 2 days and my thoughts as I was reading this book went from ""this book is so good to what is happening, I don't like where this is going, to finally that makes sense."" 

For me, it's about the cyclical nature of generational sin. Although we don't know why this had to happen to the Buendia family, why they were assigned this fate, it show us how people are bound to repeat the same mistakes their ancestors made if there is no self reflection.

We do see Ursula reflect that time is a wheel that keeps on repeating, but she doesn't share this realization to any of the family members, nor does she makes enough of an effort to free their family from this cycle.

But of course, as Meliquides ((sorry i know it's misspelled) prophecized, the fate of their family has been foretold, beginning with what Sir Francis Drake had to do.

I think this story is a mixture of the supernatural elements, witch/pagan beliefs that were present in remote 1800s villages who didn't have Christianity. It serves as a picture of that time. The depravity of man and how easily they give into lust. And how the sexual trauma's endured by some characters were not addressed and how child marriaged were normal. 

It shows that if something is born out of wrongness/something that is unnatural (incest) then it will ultimately have to end in destruction too. The incest thing reminds me of how royals interbred and would eventually succumb to a disease that killed them off.

The ending was sayistying, it tied everything in a bow, with how the consequence of the sin of Ursula and her husband became the destruction of their whole line. The Buendia's were caught between living like animals with their debauchery and sex, and half the time they would experience solitude kinda like when animals hibernate and hide themselves off until they have to hunt and be ""animals"" again.

It really does a great job at showing you real events that happened like the wars, poverty, prostitution, rape, incest, the abuse of women, withcraft, etc. through a family that managed to embody all of these things, that ultimately got destroyed because of those things as well, through a magical realist lense inorder to soften the edges of an otherwise story that still is difficult to recommend because of the horrific things that happen in the story.",chockychip,1gtidqo,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtidqo/review_of_100_years_of_solitude/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtidqo/review_of_100_years_of_solitude/,2024-11-17 17:14:40,20,0.81,20,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gtidqo
books,"Noam Chomsky Has Been Proved Right • The writer’s new argument for left-wing foreign policy has earned a mainstream hearing. (Book review ""The Myth of American Idealism"")","For more than half a century, Noam Chomsky has been arguably the world’s most persistent, uncompromising, and intellectually respected critic of contemporary U.S. foreign policy,  seeking to expose Washington’s costly and inhumane approach to the rest of the world, an approach he believes has harmed millions and is contrary to the United States’ professed values. As co-author Nathan J. Robinson writes in the preface, **The Myth of American Idealism** was written to “draw insights from across [Chomsky’s] body of work into a single volume that could introduce people to his central critiques of U.S. foreign policy.” It accomplishes that task admirably.

The central target of the book is the claim that U.S. foreign policy is guided by the lofty ideals of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, human rights, etc. For those who subscribe to this view, the damage the United States has sometimes inflicted on other countries was the unintended and much regretted result of actions taken for noble purposes and with the best of intentions. 

For Chomsky and Robinson, these claims are nonsense. Not only did the young American republic fulfill its Manifest Destiny by waging a genocidal campaign against the indigenous population, but it has since backed a bevy of brutal dictatorships, intervened to thwart democratic processes in many countries, and waged or backed wars that killed millions of people in Indochina, Latin America, and the Middle East, all while falsely claiming to be defending freedom, democracy, human rights, and other cherished ideals. U.S. officials are quick to condemn others when they violate international law, but they refuse to join the International Criminal Court, the Law of the Sea Treaty, and many other global conventions. Nor do they hesitate to violate the United Nations Charter themselves.

The record of hypocrisy recounted by Chomsky and Robinson is sobering and convincing. No open-minded reader could absorb this book and continue to believe the pious rationales that U.S. leaders invoke to justify their bare-knuckled actions.

The book is less persuasive when it tries to explain why U.S. officials act this way.  Chomsky and Robinson argue that U.S. foreign policy is largely the servant of corporate interests—the military-industrial complex, energy companies, and “major corporations, banks, investment firms. The picture is more complicated than they suggest. For starters, when corporate profits and national security interests clash, the former often lose out. Also, other great powers have acted in much the same way, inventing their own elaborate moral justifications. This behavior preceded the emergence of modern corporate capitalism.

Why do Americans tolerate policies that are costly, often unsuccessful, and morally horrendous? Their answer, which is generally persuasive, is twofold.  First, ordinary citizens lack the political mechanisms to shape policy. Second, government institutions work overtime to “manufacture consent” by classifying information, prosecuting leakers, lying to the public, and refusing to be held accountable. [Having written about these phenomena myself](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250234810/thehellofgoodintentions), I found their portrait of how the foreign-policy establishment purveys and defends its world view to be broadly accurate.

Despite some reservations, **The Myth of American Idealism** is a valuable work that provides an able introduction to Chomsky’s thinking. Indeed, if I were asked whether a student would learn more about U.S. foreign policy by reading this book or by reading a collection of the essays that current and former U.S. officials occasionally write in journals such as Foreign Affairs or the Atlantic, Chomsky and Robinson would win hands down.

I wouldn’t have written that last sentence when I began my career 40 years ago. I’ve been paying attention, however, and my thinking has evolved as the evidence has piled up. It is regrettable but revealing that a perspective on U.S. foreign policy once confined to the margins of left-wing discourse in the United States is now more credible than the shopworn platitudes that many senior U.S. officials rely on to defend their actions.

books,The Poppy War Rant,"The Poppy War Rant

""The best debut fantasy novel""- I do not agree. It was boring.

I understand it was R F Kuang's first book but it was bad. 
Rin was a brat who just wanted to do whatever she wanted to do without thinking, e.g. eating the poppy seeds without any prior experience. She was nothing but a self-centered person. 
Yes, it has been a difficult childhood for her, she had no one to support her (mentally and emotionally), and she never had any proper mentor but that is no reason for her to behave like a headless chicken wanting to prove herself. I mean, her main goal was to gain power. Don't take me wrong here because when Tom Riddle from Harry Potter series demanded the same, it was considered ""evil"".

While reading, I found the storyline so basic and predictive that since the beginning everything became clear to me. From Rin passing &gt;!the enterance test of Sinegard!&lt; and become the best student ever till the Cike finding about &gt;!the Empress's betrayal!&lt;, every thing could be predicted.

books,Thoughts on Perumal Murugan's Fire Bird. A Review.,"In the past couple of years, my life has become what I’d call as, *living out of the suitcase.* I don’t remember the last time I had halted in a singular place for more than two months at a stretch. Studies and work compel me to keep shuffling between my hometown and a host of other cities, and it is a feeling I have especially come to hate - because it means, there is no stagnancy, no stability, no proper sense of continuity. I cannot commit to long-term physical commitments. This is frustrating, because I want to stay close to my parents while also simultaneously moving around and finding a sense of belonging amidst my work. As I sit on the train stations, one trolley and a backpack at my feet – containing my whole life – I see kids frolicking around the platform, excited that they are taking a vacation, with their parents. And as I see them I realize that, that part of my life is bygone, and now, whenever I am at the station, it is to be away from home, somewhere in a land that I cannot quiet call my own. The half-heartedness of leaving a part of me back here, as I go ahead to search for the other part of me somewhere else – is both a daunting and a thrilling feeling at the same time. It is one that costs me a lot of courage, and a leap of faith.

The reason why I loved Perumal Murugan’s ***Fire Bird*** so much, is because I could see a part of me in Muthu, the protagonist. Muthu is strategically removed from his family inheritance, kicked out of his ancestral house, and left to fend for himself. He has no land and no source of livelihood at his disposal, and a wife and three children to feed. This pushes him to embark on a journey across rural Tamil Nadu to look for land that he can buy and call his own, that he can farm on, and build a house upon to shelter his family. Muthu traverses villages after villages looking for Land, that will allow him to settle down and start a life of his own. Murugan intersperses Muthu’s travels with his reminisces about his previous life. He is the youngest child of the family, the most coddled and spoilt of them all – and yet that is a life by-gone for him, because it is the same family who has pushed him out and cheated him. It is a severance that Muthu must come to terms with. It is a separation, of falling apart, that Muthu must undergo, to understand how fleeting and conditional love can be, at times, and even though they say, blood is thicker than water, turns out, wealth is the thickest of them all. In this respect*, Fire Bird* is also about what the sociological unit of ‘Family’ means. Murugan tackles the questions of, what is family? Who is family? Is family something you are born into, or is family something that you build for your own, or is it something that you induct yourself into? He complicates the understanding of what it means to be a Family, as Muthu is abandoned by his own blood, and yet is somewhat adopted by his in-law’s. It is Peruma (his wife’s) parents who take them in during the initial days of their sudden uprootedness. While Peruma has always been a foul-mouthed, loud, outrageous and caustic woman – the titular Fire Bird or *aanthapacchi* – she is the positive driving force in Muthu’s life. As Muthu is thrown out and bereft of famiy, Peruma urges him to buckle up, to not give up and to go in search for a home away from the home that they know of.  


While *Fire Bird* deals with the extreme tragedy that losing out of family is, it also deals with the joy and the pride of being able to build a family of one’s own from scratch. The book has its fair share of bittersweet moments, it is the sketch of a character broken down by the tribulations of life, who comes to triumph over them with perseverance and good-faith. 

Janani Kannan does an extremely beautiful and seamless translation, as the rural rootedness of the story is well carried over from Tamil to English. Murugan’s writing feels down-to-earth, his prose does not sensationalize poverty and rural India in the hopes of to catering to the exotic gaze of the west; instead his prose upholds the lived experiences and lived realities of indigenous life. It is a a true literary historiography from below.",midsommar_dream,1gtf53p,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtf53p/thoughts_on_perumal_murugans_fire_bird_a_review/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtf53p/thoughts_on_perumal_murugans_fire_bird_a_review/,2024-11-17 14:50:20,12,0.93,12,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gtf53p

In our western, instant gratification, binge culture, could a weekly format ever succeed? Places like Fanfiction/Royal Road are very popular and follow a chapter by chapter release, but these are of course free to consume.

books,"are there any cases of a non-fiction book that stood out to you when reading it, had very obvious personal influences that shocked you?","this comes from when i was reading a biography on Rodin by Bernard Champigneulle and 24 pages in the author writes this:

"" Father Eymard had taken it upon himself to catechize the gangs of ragged and rowdy street Arabs who roamed the quarter outside working hours. In this fringe district of Paris, workshops were multiplying, together with the horrible slums of the Butte-aux-Cailles and the Fosse-aux-Lions inhabited by working families. It must have seemed a hopeless task to woo these youngsters, few of whom had ever been to school or heard of morality, let alone religion, and most of whom regarded the cassock as an object of derision. Nevertheless, Eymard's strong and kindly personality, coupled with his rugged physique, enabled him to win over and later educate even the most hardened cases""

Ostensibly this sense of writing seem to be extremely islamophobic, however i wanted others opinions on whether i was missing context to arrive to another conclusion: that the author has chosen to write this passage in such an overtly prejudiced manner as so to indoctrinate the reader into the average opinion of the french people in such a time, as rodin or Father Eymard would have. However such a conclusion seems rather far-fetched due to the fact that the topic of the arabs is not touched upon later, nor is the behaviour of the church as Rodin later would leave the church to continue his art. It also seems to further prove my point that all history and in many cases non-fiction books as a whole are dominated by perspective, being closer to a story than objective truth. 

such cases are quite far and in between, confounding and honestly i can't seem to rationalize the reason for this text. Has anyone else come across something similar to this? The implication that Arabs are less than human, less of a person than Rodin or Father Eymard have left me quite upset. any other instances where you have come across something like this in a non-fiction book. quite displeased as a whole i must say.",memesinmyveins,1gt7mwa,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gt7mwa/are_there_any_cases_of_a_nonfiction_book_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gt7mwa/are_there_any_cases_of_a_nonfiction_book_that/,2024-11-17 06:36:35,0,0.33,0,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gt7mwa

books,"""Madame Bovary"" by Gustave Flaubert - A symbolic representation of the material and social ""idyllic life"" from multiple perspectives. ","I've noticed there a number of reviews for this book already but I'd thought I'd share my personal thoughts. This is my first written book review.

This was not a book that I had read in high school or studied in the past, in fact what drew me to this book was an episode of Seinfeld. Jerry forgets the name of one of his girlfriends who leaves a hint to him that her name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy. George provides a number of guesses in the episode, one of them being ""Bovary"". Yes, this is why I chose to read the book. As I'm sure many readers will already know, cross referencing other works in ones own art can be used to send a message, make a comparison, or emphasize contrasts, to name just a few utilities. I wanted to understand the significance of the reference both in the context of the individual Seinfeld episode as well as the series as a whole.

On the outset, I think the book is fantastic and intentionally puts forward both a moralistic/theistic critique (via the priest Abbé Bournisien) as well as a material/atheistic critique (via chemist Monsieur Homais) of which of life's desires one is ABLE to actuate in the face of life's REALITIES. ***The reality of how people and society ARE, and how they really SHOULD BE***. Obviously the two seem to be at odds for most of the book, however the two perspectives I don't believe are intended to be adversarial as opposed to complimenting each other. As the book states toward the end;

&gt;*The priest did not need any persuading; he went out to go and say mass, came back, and then they ate and hobnobbed, giggling a little without knowing why, stimulated by that vague gaiety that comes upon us after times of sadness, and at the last glass the priest said to the druggist, as he clapped him on the shoulder—* ***“We shall end by understanding one another.”***

I think this is critical, by end of the book, when it comes to the repeated motif of realities surrounding pursuit of one's life's desires both Homais and Bournisien are not actually in opposition to each other. Where their perspectives derive from may be different, but their conclusions are the same; whether it be God's will or the will of Science there does seem to be some sort of predestined FATE that is to determine the state of our being. Whether it is Spiritual or Societal. This book looks at how this fate operates and how it affects people differently in terms of comparable DREAMS or DESIRES.

This is where Madame Bovary comes into the picture.

In my interpretation, Madame Bovary is symbolic of this idyllic desirous life. SHE **IS** THE DREAM. SHE **IS** THE IDYLLIC LIFE.

Madame's increasing distaste of her husband Charles can be interpreted as HIS OWN distaste at the life that he has built. He dislikes himself. When Madame is enchanted with the Viscount and noble lifestyle of the initial feast, its symbolic of Charles' infatuation with that same society and lifestyle. Madame is HIS DREAMS, his dreams of joining them in this lifestyle. When Madame has had enough of Tostes and wants to move, its symbolizing CHARLES who has had enough of the mundane and wants to move. Her affair with Rodolphe is really just a friendship of Charles and Rodolphe, it's Charles' attempt as a lower peasant to enter higher society. The gifts that Madame buys for Rodolphe, the whip for example, or gifts for herself such as the Horse, are Charles' attempt to buy his way into that society. He continues by gallivanting in town with Leon, Madame's ""Second Affair"". This really being ""Living the dream"" of Charles going to the ballroom dances, going to theater's, slowly sending himself broke in this attempt to join that life which he is desperate to be a part of. Her affairs with Leon and Rodolphe can also be interpreted in the sense that both of them are ""living the dream"" ie getting to have sex with Madame is actualizing this dream of entering that higher life or youthful adventures, whereas Charles constantly desires them. I know some people may comment on Berthe their child, but one has to remember the context established early in the book, Charles's is a widower. So the real context is Charles is a peasant who got married early as many peasants likely did back then (and as many of lower socio-economic classes still do today) and Madame's regrets of having gotten married early are actually Charles' regrets of having done so. They have restricted him in being able to pursue a more adventurous life. He has a child and is unable to pursue lets say the adventure that Leon is able to, by traveling to Paris etc. As a man to whom novels have constructed an idyllic life in his mind, being educated, and early surrounded by people of higher status with his parents having sent him to a better education, he was exposed to, but was never truly a part of the higher richer classes.

In providing a brief break from the review I think its a good time to mention who first translated the book into English;

&gt;***Born in London, Eleanor Marx-Aveling (1855–1898) was an activist, politician, actress, translator, feminist, and youngest daughter of Karl Marx..***

I myself am not a communist, but it's quite clear that the book does possess an inherent critique at the unfairness or inequality that was present in the society of the day, and one could definitely argue as it does now. This is why Homais and Bournisien's perspectives come together at the end. Christianity implores one to consider charity from a spiritual perspective. Atheism, or if we want to use socialism purely for the sake of comparison, does the same by imploring charity from a humanist perspective if you will. That's why ""we shall end by understanding each other"". At the core of it, the two characters are also communicating ***two perspectives*** which do not actually differ in their end conclusions. Whether it be Godly fate that has made it so, or earthly fate, the odds were always stacked against Charles succeeding in this venture.

When all of Charles' attempts to join higher society fail he ultimately goes broke. Everyone ends up using him, Homais more or less sabotaged him from the beginning, he gets loan sharked and indebted by others. Rudolphe nor Leon end up helping him and finally Madame Homais wants nothing to do with him as he is now entrenched in that lower echelon of society. His life is finally compared to the Homais' and the book ends actually considering Homais state of being primarily;

&gt;***Since Bovary’s death three doctors have followed one another at Yonville without any success, so severely did Homais attack them. He has an enormous practice; the authorities treat him with consideration, and public opinion protects him. He has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour.***

***The system was more or less rigged against Charles from the beginning***. We don't even really know what ends up happening to him. At the end of the day who cares right? Who cares today even? Once you're broke and disgraced where is Christian charity? Where is secular understanding? Throughout the entire book we are constantly reminded of the fickle elements of human nature. The propensity for gossip in the town, the lack of loyalty shown towards the doctor even in informing him of Madame's affairs, the loan sharking lying and baiting.

Was there anything truly wrong in him wanting to try and enter that higher status of society? Wanting to experience more out of life? Is it wrong to dream? To be artistic? Is it a wrong realization to have that so many social pressures mold you in their image and not your own? That humanity's wretchedness always prevails? I can't say I am struck by any other theme with an over arching sentiment other than this one;

&gt;***The system was more or less rigged against Charles from the beginning***.

Whether of God or of Science, fate seems to have been pre-destined from the start...

I do have a lot more to say. If I were with you now at the Lion d' Or I would continue till early morning sharing my thoughts. In short however, the key to understanding this novel in my view, is recognizing that Madame Bovary is Primarily a symbolic character, if not SOLELY symbolic.

The book is fantastic, I really felt that I was there with everyone the whole time but now...

Like Madame Bovary herself, I am ready to leave and start a new adventure.

books,Middlesex-Jeffrey Eugenides,"Quite some time has passed since I finished that one and I have already moved forward to my next read for also quite some time, but since it will definitely make it into my top 5 of favourites that I've read this year, it would be a shame not to post about. Incredible novel, masterful in its simplicity, and the winner of a well deserved Pulitzer prize. It took no time for me to become fully invested in the story of Desdemona and Lefty, their vagarious yet heart-warming romance, and their efforts of beginning a new life in a foreign America. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the story of Milton and Tessie which followed but it was by no means displeasurable (it could be even slightly intruiging at times) and was fortunately relatively brief (the upsides of an intergenerational novel). The book picked up for me again, slowly but steadily with the birth of Cal and his unexpected journey to manhood, only to reach new heights with its last pages and an ending which i found particularly moving, both because of the much desired conclusion of his permanently present-yet up until that point never fullfilled- fling with Julie, and his final dialogue with Desdemona which fulfills her decades-old prophecy and his transformation/silkworm metaphor playing out throughout the entirety of the novel. Last but not least, being of greek descent myself, Eugenides' references were not surface level as I had mistakenly assumued they would be before reading the novel, so I'll give him that too. Overall, this novel made for an amazing reading experience. I had wanted to read it for years and it was everything I wanted it to be and more. Will definitely re-read it in the future.

books,"A Year in the Merde, by Stephen Clarke. Light-hearted, enjoyable novel about the cultural differences between France and the UK","[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10765.A\_Year\_in\_the\_Merde](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10765.A_Year_in_the_Merde)

  
This is a novel about a Brit moving to France, and trying to set up a new life there. From the blurb:

*Based on Stephen Clarke's own experiences and with names changed to ""avoid embarrassment, possible legal action, and to prevent the author's legs being broken by someone in a Yves Saint Laurent suit,"" A Year in the Merde provides perfect entertainment for Francophiles and Francophobes alike*



(Merde means excrement, and the reference is to the need to learn to walk in France avoiding dog poo)



I read it when it first came out, about 20 years ago, and I re-read it this year. This is the first book in the series; I also read the second one, but not the others.

It is a light-hearted story about the cultural differences between France and the UK. It was recommended to me by a female French colleague, who found it hilarious - and I agree. European readers might find it easier to relate to many of the points, while maybe American readers who haven't spent time in Europe might, understandably, find that harder.

  
As with anything, multiple interpretations are of course possible.



Mine is that this is a story about the cultural differences between two countries, and of how important it is to grow out of your comfort zone to grow and develop as a person. There is of course quite a lot of British humour, but what I appreciated is that the author makes fun of himself and his own culture; he does absolutely not approach this from a sense of superiority. It is of course not a PhD dissertation on the profound cultural differences between the two countries, but neither is it cheap, cheesy, cringey nonsensical entertainment like ""Emily in Paris"".

  
Of course, not everyone agrees. In this age of hyper-sensitivity, where everything and anything can be easily deemed offensive, some people took offence and saw this as offensive, sexist, and derogatory towards the French. I disagree, but to each their own - in recommending a book I think it's useful to point out why other people disliked it, even if I disagree, so that those reading this sub can make an informed decision on whether they might like this book.

books,The Virgin Suicides ,"Appreciation post to the prose of Jeffrey Eugenides. This book was tragic, beautiful, depressing and left me with a deep empathy for these characters. The boys who loved them, the parents who were left behind, and the Lisbon girls who lived and died only together. I had seen the movie, first when I was younger and again a few years back. My experience differed both times- when I was young I had no relation to these emotional women, yet. When I was older I understood this film of heartbreak and tragedy. Now I have just finished the book and am truly touched by this gaze into a family down the street whom no one understands and left to mystery.

books,My review of The Lottery!,"This story caught me completely off guard. I went in with no idea what to expect, and it was much shorter than I anticipated—just 30 pages. But wow, it achieved so much with so little.

One of the most intriguing aspects is how little context is provided about the lottery itself. It’s a tradition, but the reason behind it? We’re left in the dark. Even the townspeople don’t seem to remember why it started, and that mystery adds to its impact. Honestly, I think if we were given more explanation, it might not have hit as hard.

Shirley Jackson’s writing is masterful. It’s short, sharp, and direct. The prose is sparse, yet it manages to pack in an incredible amount of emotion. The characters are just ordinary people—we don’t know much about them, but that simplicity is part of the story’s strength.

What really stood out to me is how the tone shifts as the story progresses. At first, the lottery feels like a festive event, almost exciting. But as it unfolds, a sense of dread creeps in. The tension builds and builds until the final, chilling reveal. It’s fascinating how Jackson manipulates your emotions in such a small amount of space.

The world-building is another standout. In just 30 pages, Jackson vividly sets the scene, making the story’s setting feel grounded and real. It’s a testament to her talent that she could create something so immersive in such a short format.

I’m thoroughly impressed by this story’s depth, themes, and emotional weight. Shirley Jackson’s skill is undeniable. This experience has made me want to pick up *The Haunting of Hill House*—I loved the Netflix adaptation, and I’m sure the novel is even better!

Lastly, it’s clear that *The Lottery* has influenced pop culture in major ways (*Hunger Games*, anyone?). It’s an incredibly written story, packed with thought-provoking ideas and an unsettling atmosphere that leaves you thinking long after you’ve finished.

If you haven’t read *The Lottery*, I highly recommend it. It’s short, impactful, and an excellent starting point if you’re looking to get into reading more fiction.

books,A religious person’s thoughts on The Handmaid’s Tale,"I want to preface this by saying that this review is based on my own thoughts and experiences and do not reflect those of every Christian. I just made this post because being familiar with the Bible gives the book a whole other layer which I found interesting. 

So I went into this book completely blind without reading any reviews or discussions on it. I had heard of The Handmaid’s Tale before but literally did not know anything about it…which is surprising considering how popular the book is. Because of this, I was so lost until like the first quarter of the book when things had began to unfold. Once I got the hang of what was going on, I was shook. I loved Atwood’s use of non-linear storytelling. Although this made it difficult to follow the story at some point, I still think it was such a great way to keep the suspense and interest throughout the book. 

I was shocked at how real the book is. This book was written decades ago but still related to today’s decade in so many ways it’s scary. Although the chances of our world being thrown into a totalitarian government are slightly lower, it’s scary how (somewhat easy it will be). The book was able to capture that sentiment quite well. 

Now on to my thoughts about the book from a religious perspective. I consider the book a very good critique of Christian nationalism. From Wikipedia *“Christian nationalism is a form of religious nationalism that focuses on promoting the Christian views of its followers in order to achieve prominence or dominance in political and social life”*   In simple terms, using the Bible and God to gain power over others. This occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages and even today there are quite a number of countries that still follow the ideologies of Christian nationalism. The portrayal of this ideology in the book is so spot on. One way is the use of biblical verses to reinforce certain ideas. In the Handmaid’s Tale, certain bible verses are repeated over and over during certain events that they are entrained in the people’s subconscious minds. You see it a lot in the main character because although she is not a believer, at some point, she becomes influenced. 

Another way that Christian nationalist is portrayed in The Handmaid’s Tale is also the gatekeeping of the Bible or even any information in general. Bible’s are kept locked up and only opened during certain events for specific people to read. This is similar to what the Catholic church enforced during the Middle Ages where only priests had access to the Bible and the Bible could only be read in Latin. What this creates is that the people in power are able to bend the rules to their will…This is what we see in the Handmaid’s Tale where people in power are able to take certain liberties their subsidiaries cannot

I loved this book so much because of how spot on it is in showing how societies an easily be shaped to conform to certain ideologies especially by keeping people in ignorance. I hear it has been banned in certain schools in the States, which is so ironic considering the contents of the book. Reading the book as someone who has a bit of Bible knowledge was so interesting because I noticed how certain verses were taken out of context or tweaked to fit the oppressor’s narrative. The oppressors did not even have to change or uphaul much of the words in the Bible, but by keeping people in ignorance and constant indoctrination, a totalitarian state was created where people would not question anything. I rate this book an easy 4.3/5 stars. I regret waiting so long to read it.

books,Just feel frustrated with people who think fiction (as opposed to nonfiction) is a waste of time. ,"Had a bit of a debate with someone online about fiction vs. nonfiction. It came out of nowhere. The guy was talking about reading a certain president's memoir, then suddenly changed topics and said the following (paraphrasing a bit to leave us the swear words): ""I used to read fiction when I was younger but then I grew up and realized that it's time to step out of fantasy and into reality.""

He was a history buff and felt history is the ultimate nonfiction and that many of our world's problems was that young kids were sucked into fiction (he especially hated fantasy books) and know nothing about history, then grow up and repeat past's mistakes.

I ended the debate because I knew fiction matters yet was unable to defend my position, unable to explain what made fiction important. I could only say we as human beings are storytellers and that stories have been a part of our lives since the beginning. His sarcastic response was if I had read that in a nonfiction book.

Obviously he is not the only person who feels that way about nonfiction. I've come across this view before, although it comes in various flavors and different justifications. My problem is with the black-and-white nature of it. He constantly made it seem as if I was anti-nonfiction. You can value both fiction and nonfiction, can't you? And can criticize both as well. It's totally fine to say certain book of fiction is awful or a waste of time, but why go and label all of them so? I mean this guy was college educated and smart, so how could he think that way?",Gypsy-horse,1gr0sbn,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gr0sbn/just_feel_frustrated_with_people_who_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gr0sbn/just_feel_frustrated_with_people_who_think/,2024-11-14 09:04:21,890,0.88,890,0,563,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gr0sbn
books,"A week in December, Sebastian Faulks. Boring, poorly researched novel; no depth to the characters.","[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6378740-a-week-in-december](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6378740-a-week-in-december)

  
**Review (no spoilers).**

  
This novel by British author Sebastian Faulks was published in 2009. When reading it, I did my best to try to imagine reading it as if we were still in 2009: the great financial crisis, Lehman Brothers, etc, but even that fails to salvage this novel.

  
The novel is about a series of overlapping stories, which are meant to reflect the complexity and multi-culturality of modern British society. As a Guardian review summarises:

  
[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/05/sebastian-faulks-novel-review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/05/sebastian-faulks-novel-review)

*A hedge-fund manager contrives to profit from the crash of a leading bank; a skunk-addicted teenager becomes obsessed with a house-sharing TV game-show; a barrister is about to defend a London Underground driver in a health and safety case; an Asian chutney tycoon prepares to collect his OBE at the Palace while his teenage son, converted to militancy, learns bomb-making through the local mosque. And a newspaper book-reviewer plots to destroy the career of a dangerously rising rival.*



I hated the book, because there was absolutely no depth to the characters. The story builds up to suggest some kind of big finale which, however, never really materialises.

Part of the plot involves a financial fraud; of course the novel was published in 2009, so the aftermath of the financial crisis was still very real. The problem is that the author's entire research on that seems to have been 3 minutes spent on Wikipedia; that part of the plot reminds me of the supervillain in a children cartoon: unrealistic, and with zero depth. It's a shame, because there was so much that could have been written and analysed about that (the groupthink, the hubris, the self-delusion, etc) but the book doesn't even scratch the surface.

The poor research was more evident in the financial fraud story, but even the other stories are told with a similar lack of depth. It's hard to elaborate more without spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.

  
The last comment is that I am well aware that the book sold many copies and reviews were mostly positive. It seems I was in the minority disliking the book.",not_who_you_think_99,1gqzomk,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gqzomk/a_week_in_december_sebastian_faulks_boring_poorly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gqzomk/a_week_in_december_sebastian_faulks_boring_poorly/,2024-11-14 07:38:08,9,0.68,9,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gqzomk
books,Novelizations ,"Among my book collection, I have a great collection of novelizations. When going to bookstores, I like to collect old novelizations (especially those that are out of print) of both popular and cult classic movies. 

In addition to feeling like a literary souvenir of the movie, reading a novelization also feels like a director’s cut of the film, with additional scenes and going deeper into the characterizations. 

The 70s &amp; 80s were definitely a peak period for the novelization, where I’ve been able to find a great number of novels of films and shows. They’re still doing novelizations (I just recently ordered the novelization of X: The Movie and pre-ordered the novelization of Pearl) but (at least to me) they don’t seem to be as big as they once were. 

What are your thoughts on novelizations? And do you have any in your collection?

books,[SPOILERS] I finished Anna Karenina ,"Spoilers
...
...
...

I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are? I was taken aback by the ending, but when I think about it it makes sense. So it's good in that way. That's the perfect kind of ending even, right. Where it takes you off guard but it still works.

I don't agree with the idea that the ending reduces the narrative to a sensibility novel. I was often astonished while reading this 19th century novel, by how brazenly it advocates for the concept of women as human beings. The text always treats social double standards as not only hypocritical, but unfair, and makes no excuses for the different ways that society treats men and women.

I hated part 8. If Levin were an aquaintance or my brother I am sure I'd love him but since he is neither, I just find him tedious more than anything. 

The character work in this novel was fucking amazing, like gold standard. It's an amazing book in general. Still wish that we'd have gotten just a little more about certain characters that were beginning to get interesting to me. But all characters were plausible and well written.",EmpressPlotina,1gqqyxi,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gqqyxi/spoilers_i_finished_anna_karenina/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gqqyxi/spoilers_i_finished_anna_karenina/,2024-11-13 23:34:06,184,0.89,184,0,86,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gqqyxi
books,"Unsung Heroes from the book ""The Small &amp; Mighty"" by Sharon McMahon","Has anyone read *The Small &amp; The Mighty* by Sharon McMahon? 

The book tells the stories of 12 unsung heroes who helped shape the nation in ways we don’t hear about often. I actually got to interview Sharon about some of these characters and how she brings their stories to life. I wanted to share my book notes on some the figures:

**Gouverneur Morris:** Known as one of America’s “forgotten” Founding Fathers, Morris was pivotal in crafting the Constitution’s Preamble. Although frequently overshadowed, he opposed slavery and a memorable speaker at the Constitutional Convention (he simplified and finalized the Constitution) 

**Clara Brown - The Angel of the Rockies:** Born enslaved, Clara’s path was unfathomable. After securing her freedom at 56, she headed West, amassing a fortune and becoming a key figure in Colorado (might have been the first black person in Colorado). She built churches, aided those in need, and was even friends with the Governor of the State. 

**Virginia Randolph:** A true trailblazer in Black education, Randolph viewed teaching as a mission (She talked about educating the whole individual: The Hands, eyes, feet and soul) , often using her own funds to improve schools in the South. Virginia believed that children learned more from who you are than what you teach—a philosophy that fueled her 60-year legacy in education.

**The Hello Girls:** These pioneering women served as U.S. Army telephone operators during WWI, relaying crucial messages on the front lines. Because of their serves, they ultimately pushed the President to give Women the right to vote in 1917; although they weren’t granted military status until 1977.

**Claudette Colvin’s Stand for Civil Rights:** Nine months before Rosa Parks famously refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus, 15-year-old Claudette Colvin took the initial stance. McMahon highlights Colvin’s bravery and the personal cost she bore as one of the youngest voices in the civil rights movement (Rosa Parks was suprised when she met her and saw how young she was).

If you’ve read *The Small &amp; The Mighty*, what did you think of these stories?

books,What the shazbot was the deal with the last chapter of Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing?,"I read this book in first grade. Judy Blume’s stories are generally lighthearted and comical, with some kind of low-key mischief going on in each of the first nine chapters. But then, in the tenth, we got:

* three-year-old Fudge swallowing a months-old turtle **whole**
* Fudge bragging as others laugh at Peter on the way to take him to the hospital
* Peter asking if he lost his pet and all the adults just being annoyed and nonchalant
* Fudge being given a party when he gets home, without the parents giving him any indication that eating a pet is wrong
* Peter’s family ignoring him at this party, then shoving a pet dog on him at the end as a surprise present

books,"What are the most unforgettable child-parent relationship from a book you've read, whether fiction or non-fiction?","I've often wondered to what extent a big part of the appeal of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird for me is about justice in face of racial prejudice, which I think is very important theme. Or the trial, which is the reason I wanted to read it (I'm interested in legal dramas). Or it if has something to do with the relationship between father and his young daughter, Scout (the narrator).

Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is a widow who does an outstanding job not only as a lawyer but also as a father. He has great compassion, wisdom, and a strong sense of moral that he has tried to also instill in his kids. As you read the book, you see him again and again teach his kids that you gotta be brave and do the right thing even if almost the whole town is against you.

I quite enjoyed the relationship between Scout and her dad and starting to think that has been a big reason the book holds a special place for me. And wonder if there are other parent-child relationships that well-read posters like yourself found memorable from your readings?

To be clear, they don't have to fictional or positive. Terrible relationships are sometimes even harder to forget.

books,“Maus” in the modern era ,"I finally had the chance to read *Maus*, a book I’d been meaning to pick up for years but kept putting off. I didn’t choose it specifically with the American election in mind, but reading it now felt coincidentally relevant. One thing that stands out across the book—and in much of WWII history—is that Hitler’s horrific actions didn’t start overnight; the Nazi rise was a gradual, chilling progression. Vladek’s story captures this slow build-up, where the early, smaller aggressions against Jews steadily grow, culminating in the full horror of the Holocaust.

I’m not saying the future of American government will mirror the events in Austria, Poland, and elsewhere under the Nazi regime because I don't want to diminish the severity of those times. But history has a way of repeating itself, and I want to stay aware of unsettling patterns we might see emerging.",PinkToucan_,1gq5czz,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gq5czz/maus_in_the_modern_era/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gq5czz/maus_in_the_modern_era/,2024-11-13 05:02:29,981,0.9,981,0,187,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gq5czz
books,"The last odyssey: ""3001: The Final Odyssey"" by Arthur C. Clarke.","So now I've finally finished the last of Clarke's Odyssey Novels!

The space Odyssey that began with ""2001"" has just reached its ultimate stage. It is now 3001, and the human race is still thriving, but with the trio monoliths that still dominate the Solar System.

But then one single hope has flickered. Frank Poole's body, which many thought was dead for a thousand years, has been found in the frozen reaches of the galaxy.

He is then brought back to conscious life and has been readied to continue the journey that was terminated by HAL a thousand years ago. And he knows that he can't proceed with this without Dave Bowman. But right now he must find out the terrifying truth of what both Bowman and HAL have become within the monolith.

So here in the fourth, and final, book of the Odyssey series we make the very big jump through millenniums instead of just years! And into the far flung year of 3001! This final installment (like the third) is also very decent. That adventure aspect is still pretty much there as it was in the last one, and enjoyed it very much.

One thing I've noticed in the final two books, and it was brought to my attention by someone in the comment section of my previous post on ""2061"", that Clarke has put in a lot of emphasis of possible technology in the future. Honestly this doesn't really bother me at all, though some might find it a bit annoying.

Sure, both ""2061"" and ""3001"" may not be as profound as the first two books, they're still enjoyable in my opinion.

books,The character collects information that is not necessary for the plot. Are you for or against this?,"Lately, I've been reading a certain author who liked to take a break from the plot in books and give the character unnecessary informatics. I will give examples from two of her books so that you understand what I mean when I say that the information is unnecessary in the books and you understand the essence of the question.

1. The book ""Bolotnitsa"". The genre is Folklore horror. The character arrives in the village. The girl, before starting any groundwork for the plot, begins to remember useless horror stories that are needed only for the atmosphere. There were 3 horror stories, quite long. Then the plot began to happen, father went to the city, and mother was stolen by a kikimora. And she reads the notes and then listens to the old woman's stories. All this is necessary to explain what kind of monster, BUT we already know this from the plot. They explained to us that there is a well because of which kikimira gets out and gave all the explanations about her essence. And the notes only explain that the headman lived in this house, about whom we have already been told in conversations.

2. The book ""Cat's Head"". The genre of Folklore is horror. At first there was a plot, but then there was a break in the middle again. There was no plot all through the middle, but the character collected stories about mysticism from the mouths of the villagers, which are long again, sometimes something mystical happened to him, but that's not the point.

books,Weirdly specific trope of reclusive female authors,"I've noticed several books I've read lately have involved an element of a reclusive female author. 

I just thought it was kind of interesting and maybe even a sort of trend? The Thirteenth Tale by Dianne Setterfield, The Hazel Wood by Melissa Albert, Starling House by Alix Harrow, A History of Wild Places by Shea Ernshaw, Daisy Darker by Alice Feeny (sort of). 

All of the books have a similar Gothic vibe, and I believe at least three of the fictional authors were described as writing some sort of twisted fairy tales or disturbing stories for children. 

It seems like such a specific trope to randomly encounter multiple times without seeking it out. Was The Thirteenth Tale the start of the trope and then others were inspired by it maybe?

books,A Song to Drown Rivers - rant with me?,"Okay first of all, I know nothing of the actual story of Xishi, so this is only my opinion on the book. I thought the first 80% was just okay. Xishi was really just another annoying FMC to me. My biggest complaints are the ending because WTF?

(Zhengdan deserved the world and I would have loved to see more of her. What a queen!)


Fuchai SHOULD have been Xishi's real lover. It could have been a beautiful enemies to lovers romance. Xishi seemed to understand, after a while, that war is just terrible for both sides. There is no right and wrong. The Yue see the Wu as monsters, but the Wu see the Yue the same way. Both sides do terrible things.
Fuchai clearly seemed to genuinely love her. They actually share so many passionate moments, and friendly times, that I really thought they were end game. He even offers to leave his kingdom so they can just live together free of worries and politics. WTF DOES FANLI EVEN OFFER? That man pushed her to complete a dangerous mission, and would only be with her AFTER HIS DUTY IS DONE? BRUH

HOW is there any comparison? 10 weeks with Fanli, no kisses or intimacy, no passion really. No sacrifice, no declarations of love, no gifts of kindness. I felt 0 chemistry between the two of them.

I cannot believe she did not understand her feelings before straight up murdering Fuchai... And then after a good little crying sesh, she is ready to find her one true love (that, again, she has never kissed or even mentioned their love for eachother explicitly)?

Okay. At this point, I am angry that Fuchai was dealt such a horrible end. But at least we get a happy ending for Xishi and Fanli right?? haHA. 

Oh what an ominous note, it probably means nothing ... oh how weird King Yue's other spy got executed by the KING for being a spy... weird but I can't wait to see Fanli!
I have this really weird feeling I am being watched... it's fine I will be with Fanli soon!
(Am I really to believe this girl is smart enough to take down a kingdom?)

And then MURDERED? That is absolutely ridiculous and where the hell is her ESCORT? Rui is just nowhere to be found even though he KNOWS she is in probable danger?

THEN WE GET INTO SOME WEIRD SPIRIT CRAP where she can haunt people's dreams. That was just random and dumb. Absolutely no mention of anything like it until it was thrown into the ending. 

So she waits. For this guy who only kissed her in his dreams after she was murdered. For the guy who didn't sacrifice anything for her, so that he could do his job. For the guy she knew 10ish weeks. For the guy who knew she was in trouble but couldn't take time away from his job to come see her after she finally finished her job and allowed the Yue to take down the Wu. Yes... a note should suffice! 

What a terrible, annoying ending. It was unexpected in a bad way.

Please tell me I am not the only one here....

books,Appreciation for The Railway Children ,"Sorry this is not a super in/depth post or anything, but I just met Jenny Agutter who plays Bobby in the 1970 film of The Railway Children- super nice human and it’s just bought a tonne of childhood memories flooding back about how great the book was, how much it inspired me to love trains to this day, and what a great escapism it was. I listened to the audiobook on repeat and loved how trains be and characters in the story. I also went on to work with people affected by imprisonment of a family member, and I always wonder if it was this book that planted the seed of why that matters.

books,The Lost Bookshop by Evie Woods,"The Lost Bookshop is an interesting one; I picked it up on a whim (more precisely, because I liked the title and the cover), and was charmed by it for sure! One of these books that really feel like it was both written by and for book lovers. Which is - in my eyes - it's major draw. Recommended for those who love books enough they can get interested in their history, and find it easy to believe that books could whisper to you once you put them down.

Only vague spoilers of story vibes ahead!

**Genre:** I do like the genre of magical realism this is, although found it a bit frustrating that until the VERY end of the book, the characters blithely ignore that magic is happening! Maybe that means there was a bit too much realism in my magic here 😆

**POV:** The book does suffer from having three points of view to tell a story, with only one of these three characters feeling like a main character. The other two were kind of around, if you know what I mean... they were supposed to be connected, but even that connection felt tenuous, relying (imo) too much on the magic that none of them were acknowledging. I did like how the author picked up different serious themes through all of their stories, but the difference in how important one single viewpoint felt compared to the others carried through most of the book as a result.

As an aside, my favorite character was not among the 3 POV characters, but might be argued to be the real main character. Which is very interesting to me! But I can't talk in more detail about that without getting REAL spoiler-y.

**Feelings on the ending:** I've not been reading books just for the fun of reading in a while, and I seem to have developed an overly critical view on endings, often feeling like a story resolves too easily. Felt the same about The Lost Bookshop! Nothing was ruined by that feeling, but it left an aftertaste.

books,"The only ""meh"" review you will ever read for Malazan Book of the Fallen - 7/10","Last year I started a search for the most Epic fantasy series ever written. A broad interpretation brought a broad list of series, but I decided on *Malazan Book of the Fallen* becuase it was advertised as super dense, complicated with politics and war, with prose bordering on literature-quality.

And boy was that all true.

I sort of enjoyed my 400 hours of reading (and listening to the magnificent Michael Page's audiobooks) of this 10 book series. I found, both before and after reading, that there were 2 camps of people when it comes to Malazan: People who think it is exceptional, and people who did not finish the first or second book. 

Well I finished it and I thought the whole experience was maybe not worth the time.... But I did enjoy many aspects of it... but even after I'm done I don't understand a lot of what the large plotlines were... Anyway here is the good and the bad from maybe the only person who thinks the entire thing was ""meh"":

***Pros***

1. There are some truly excellent fantasy elements to this story. There are gods. There are heroes. There are villains. There is magic. There is humor. There is tragedy. Like a LOT of tragedy. Anyone who likes fiction will be able to find stuff about these books they like.

2. A wide cast of characters that a reader can draw favor to. I can't imagine reading these books and not liking a handful of people.

3. The world is extremely complete. The author is an anthropologist, and it shows. Everything has history in these books: cities are ancient, and there is proof. There are flashbacks to the city when a different intelligent species lived there. Same with the land.

4. The military campaigns that took up a book length of reading were really good. The Chain of Dogs in the second book was some of the most exciting reading I've done.

5. Some of the deaths and battles were legendary. Don't want to spoil anything but there are some legendary scenes by anyone's standards.

6. There are some fairly unique things about Malazan that are just super fricken cool. There is a sword that is itself a world and captures the souls of the slain to pull a wagon away from Chaos itself.

***Cons***

1. The world is complex. Too complex for me. I read 10 books and I still don't understand some major plotlines (why did this god do that? Why did he want to?). Before beginning the series I read somewhere that the author wanted a series that you could reread and get just as much enjoyment out of it as the first time, and that it didn't lose that magical feeling that a book series can capture. I actually think if I were to re-read the series I would enjoy it more, but I absolutely do not have 400 hours to do that again lol.

2. It feels like some things are *deliberately* confusing for literally no other reason than to be confusing. Names of characters are super similar. Often a new POV will start with something like ""her hands were shaking in the cold, for the windows remained open for the breeze..."" and he won't tell you who the F he's actually taking about for a paragraph or two. Sure he sprinkles in some details sometimes that you'll remember ""oh it's cold in THIS location because THIS magic happened 5 chapters ago"" and you're suppose to remember that minute detail from 10 hours of reading ago.

3. The prose is extremely dense. I usually listen to books at ~1.5 speed. I listened to books 8 and 9 at 1.2 speed and quite frankly it was far too fast. I listened to important parts at 1.0 and the entire 10th book at 1.0. The plots, subplots, and major story arcs are complex already. Throw in some actual English literature and it get's super super difficult to go through quickly. My favorite quote from the book actually is a great example of this:

&gt;As if true honesty belonged to solitude, since to be witnessed was to perform, and performance was inherently false since it invited expectation.

Stuff like this that you could just sit and think about for half an hour.... and it's page after page after page of this stuff! Definitely not for me, although this is just a preference and not an actual complaint.

4. There are plotlines that just don't matter at all to the story (as far as I can tell, I could be wrong, but see CONS 1, 2, and 3 lol). Like the series could have very easily been 1 book less and been just as good or better.

5. I don't understand why every character deliberately withholds information from others, and thus deliberately withholds information from the reader. Many many times there will be 2 characters in a mini-arms race of trying to figure out what the other knows about a mutually held goal and the characters will not say what they know. They will make implications of things they know that would reveal the least information possible to the other person. I have no idea why this distrust of people in the same group/army/race is such a huge theme in these books, and I honestly assume it's just the author being withholding for the sake of it. I am yet to discover a reason why Quick Ben doesn't tell anyone his plans, etc.

6. Characters are continually introduced so deep into the book that I assumed they were not important and were going to die off. But no, the character introduced in book 9 plays a  foundational role in book 10.... I just can't keep the 100s of people in my head!

***Overall***

Some truly exceptional parts in an extremely complex (both literally and narratively) world that nearly demands a reread for a basic level of understanding. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other books out there that I can spend 400 hours on that I have more confidence will be easier, more fun, yet just as enjoyable to read. To give a great example of all of the above, I present my favorite comedic non-spoiler scene, complete with as much context as the author gives from the book Midnight Tides (the 5th book in the series where we are on a new continent will all new characters lol):

&gt;As they walked, Tehol spoke. ""...the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences.

&gt;""I know what you're thinking, to which I have no choice but to challenge you both. Like this. Imagine walking down this street, doling out coins by the thousands. Until everyone here is in possession of vast wealth. A solution? No, you say, because among these suddenly rich folk there will be perhaps a majority who will prove wasteful, profligate and foolish, and before long they will be poor once again. Besides, if wealth were distributed in such a fashion, the coins themselves would lose all value - they would cease being useful. And without such utility, the entire social structure we love so dearly would collapse. 

&gt;""Ah, but to that I say, so what? There are other ways of measuring self-worth. To which you both heatedly reply: with no value applicable to labour, all sense of worth vanishes! And in answer to that I simply smile and shake my head. Labour and its product be- come the negotiable commodities. But wait, you object, then value sneaks in after all! Because a man who makes bricks cannot be equated with, say, a man who paints portraits. Material is inherently value-laden, on the basis of our need to assert comparison- but ah, was I not challenging the very assumption that one must proceed with such intricate structures of value?

&gt;""And so you ask, what's your point, Tehol? To which I reply with a shrug. Did I say my discourse was a valuable means of using this time? I did not. No, you assumed it was. Thus proving my point!""

&gt;""I'm sorry, master"" Bugg said, ""but what was your point?""

&gt;""I forget. But we've arrived.

books,Nostalgia Overload: Rediscovering My Old Box of Sidney Sheldon Novels,"So I recently got a box of my old books and it was filled with Sidney Sheldon novels. It took me down a memory lane where Sidney Sheldon was a huge part of my teenage years. I loved diving into his books—they were just crafted so exceptionally well, with gripping plots, intense suspense, and those signature twists that left me reeling every time. Few authors can match that blend of drama and intrigue, and Sheldon knew exactly how to keep readers hooked from start to finish.

Some of my favorites are *Nothing Lasts forever* and *The Best Laid Plans*. Sheldon’s characters, especially the leading women, were always captivating. They were powerful, resilient, and clever, even if they did all seem to be both beautiful and brilliant. But even with that, his storytelling made these characters feel so real and unforgettable.

books,I Hope This Finds You Well,"I got this  from the library because I thought I saw it in a thread about funny books.

 I was expecting something very fluff and light. I did not expect it to be as riveting as it was!  I really loved the premise of being able to know what everyone thinks about you and being able to get a peek inside the curtain of people’s lives and thoughts. Probably because I am by nature a nosy person and always want to be a fly on the wall in certain people’s lives. 

1. It kept me hooked! There were a lot of twists and turns that made me want to find out what was really going on.

2. It really painted a good portrait of someone with anxiety. 
How anxiety doesn’t just affect how you interact with people but also how self absorbed it makes you! Thinking everything has to do with you, you’re the center of the universe. There were plenty of things that MC thought was about her and I wanted to shake her and say “Not everything is about you! Other people have their own things going on! 

3. While it wasn’t quite as laugh out loud funny as I anticipated, it was still funny and MC’s voice was super dry and sarcastic which I loved.

One thing I didn’t care for- the ending was happy and everything was tied up in a neat little package with a bow, while that made me feel good realistically I don’t think that would have happened in a story like this. 

I was also able to predict some of foibles that were coming, except for one really blew me away.

books,Do you have a trigger word? A word that let's you know you're going to hate a book?,"I am currently forcing my way through From Blood and Ash by Jennifer Armentrout and the word ""crimson"" is used far too often and makes me cringe every time. It was in the first paragraph telling me right then I'd made a mistake. It bothers me more than all of the other textbook tropes.


It always reminds me of that scene in 10 Things I Hate About You where the guidance counselor is trying to write her smutty romance novel.

books,Blind Dates with a Book ,"I’ve seen this trend mentioned here and there in articles, videos or reddit posts. I think it is quite well-known, but in case anyone maybe hasn’t heard of it, blind date with a book is the scheme (?) of bookstores selling wrapped books, with little to no information about their contents. This is done in order for people to maybe discover stories and works they wouldn’t have read otherwise, although I suppose it is also a way for bookstores to get rid off unwanted books that don’t sell.

I know this is a well-known little trick, but I mention it because I’ve never actually seen it happening in bookshops over here in my country, neither in large chains nor in smaller indie shops – and I’m honestly a bit frustrated about it, because, regardless of the reason a bookshop decides to do it, I think it is something fun, and an interesting way of discovering books you otherwise wouldn’t have look at.

So, I’d also like to ask about your stories with blind book dates. Have you ever bought a book that way? Did you end up liking it or hating it? Maybe you discovered something amazing you wouldn’t have to otherwise. Just to ease up this frustration of mine and maybe also help share some interesting stories.",A_Guy195,1goe734,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1goe734/blind_dates_with_a_book/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1goe734/blind_dates_with_a_book/,2024-11-10 23:30:41,89,0.92,89,0,86,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1goe734

books,The Moth &amp; The Flame,"While studying Greene's fascinating observations in 'The Art of Seduction' - where he documents historical patterns of influence and attraction - I stumbled upon Rumi's Essential Works. One particular metaphor stopped me cold: the moth and the flame.

Greene observes how influential figures throughout history used mystery and strategy in relationships. He doesn't prescribe these as tactics, but rather shows how they've played out across centuries. It's anthropology of seduction, if you will.

Then comes Rumi's moth - flying straight into the flame, embracing its own destruction. Not calculating, not observing, just pure devotion. While Greene documents how people protect and position themselves, Rumi suggests the opposite - complete surrender as the highest form of connection.

What fascinates me is how both authors study the same human experience from completely different angles. Greene looks at the patterns of how people behave, while Rumi examines why at the deepest level.

Has anyone else found themselves caught between these perspectives? How do you reconcile Greene's keen observations of human nature with Rumi's call for transcending it entirely?",VelvetCharrm,1gob0gg,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gob0gg/the_moth_the_flame/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gob0gg/the_moth_the_flame/,2024-11-10 21:09:54,1,0.52,1,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gob0gg
books,My Favourite Dystopian Novel: Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler,"I have been a big fan of dystopian novels since my late teens, and currently, there seems to be more and more people reading/writing them than ever. As such, I wanted to take the time to make an informative post about my absolute favourite dystopian novel ever that I believe was truly ahead of it's time and is criminally under-read by the populace.

So, if you're looking for a dark, thoughtful dystopian novel, I highly, *highly* suggest you try **Octavia E. Butler's** *Earthseed Duology*.

The first book is titled *Parable of the Sower* and the second is titled *Parable of the Talents*. Despite the titles, these texts very much critique organised religion, religious fundamentalism, and more specifically Christianity. While being written in '93 and '98 respectively, they remain more relevant than ever, set in a post-pox (short for apocalypse) America where people are fighting amongst one another for resources and life is more unstable than ever.

The first novel follows a young woman named Lauren Olamina who is a ""sharer"" (someone who can feel the pain of others) just before and after she is forced to flee from the only home she has ever known. As she travels north in search of a new life, she makes a conscious effort to reach out to other downtrodden members of society while creating a religion of her own that she has envisioned and titled Earthseed. This religion is unlike many others as it does not focus nor believe in a supernatural entity as a God, instead the core beliefs of Earthseed are that ""God is change"" and that ""all that you touch, you change, all that you change, changes you"".

The religion promotes survival, community, and hope for the future - something that is desperately needed for the struggling people of this dystopian world. However, not everybody takes kindly to Earthseed and there are many struggles that even Lauren cannot forsee or prevent.

The two novels are very dark at times and are definitely not for the faint of heart, but they predict a lot about current struggles facing America in 2024 and beyond, including climate change, social inequality, international war, and an increasingly polarising political landscape. The best example of this is in the second novel when a Christian extremist president comes into power using the slogan ""Make America Great Again"".

These novels were well-received at the time and critically acclaimed. Parable of the Sower won the 1994 New York Times Notable Book of the Year award. Parable of the Talents won the 2000 Nebula Award for Best Novel. Additionally, in 1995, Octavia E. Butler was the first science-fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Genius grant for her work. 

If you'd like any content warnings or more information, feel free to ask below. I'm always excited to talk about this series and Butler in general. Please support this incredible author and I encourage you to read more from Black women in general, their perspectives and creativity are unparalleled and have never been more valuable.",cascadingtundra,1go8ntr,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1go8ntr/my_favourite_dystopian_novel_parable_of_the_sower/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1go8ntr/my_favourite_dystopian_novel_parable_of_the_sower/,2024-11-10 19:28:48,410,0.95,410,0,76,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1go8ntr
books,"Autocracy, inc. The dictators who want to run the world, by Anne Applebaum","[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183932735-autocracy-inc](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183932735-autocracy-inc)

Anne Applebaum is an American journalist and historian.

In this book she describes how modern autocracies, despite being fairly different from each other and not sharing many ideological traits, can and do collaborate with each other to remain in power.

Exposure to democracy and to the West has not softened many dictators, and the fall of the Berlin Wall did not mean the fall of all autocracies.

In this book, the author examines the common techniques used by most autocrats all over the globe, and how they collaborate with each other.

One of the most interesting quotes is:

*Western and especially American students of foreign policy often look at the world as a series of separate issues—eastern Europe, the Middle East, the South China Sea—each requiring a different cadre of experts or specialists. But that isn’t how autocracies see the world. Putin backs far-right and extremist movements in Europe and provides thugs and weapons to support African dictatorships. He pursues victory in Ukraine by creating food shortages and raising energy prices around the world. Iran maintains proxies in Lebanon, Palestine, Yemen, and Iraq. Iranian agents have also bombed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, carried out murders in Istanbul and Paris, plotted assassinations in the United States, and funded media throughout the Arab-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds. The Belarusian dictator tried to destabilize his neighbors by luring refugees from the Middle East and helping them cross illegally into Europe. Cuban troops have gone to fight against Ukraine in Russia, while Cuban secret policemen1* *help protect the Maduro regime in Venezuela. China, with deep economic and political interests across Africa and Latin America, has not thought of itself as an “Asian” power for many years.*

I liked the book, because Applebaum explains matters which affect us all, with a clear style, that presupposes no prerequisite knowledge of modern history or geopolitics.

Those who are looking for easy solutions to ""fix the world"" and topple dictators will be disappointed - the author does not offer easy solutions to complex problems; yes, in her epilogue ""democrats united"" she mentions, amongst other things, what the West can do to make it harder for kleptocrats to launder money, buy prized real estate, etc, but she's mature and realistic enough to appreciate that there is no quick and easy recipe  guaranteed to work against dictators.

Possibly the only part I didn't like is that the author didn't really analyse what to do, what is best for the population in question but also, selfishly, for the West, when a country run by a dictator is not ready for an alternative. Toppling Saddam Hussein in Iraq was an example. Toppling Gaddafi in Libya another one - the country plunged into chaos, the Islamic state ended up a stone's throw away from Italy and therefore from the southern border of the European Union, etc.

  
**UPDATE**: thank you all for the comments and the links you shared. I knew the author was right of centre, but I probably hadn't appreciated how much; I am not in the US and don't follow US politics as closely as an American would. It is now clearer to me how hypocritical she really is on a number of points, glossing over all the atrocities committed or supported by the US abroad, including propping up terrible regimes. Of course this is a very nuanced topic, which cannot be reduced to good vs villains, but at the very least, for these very reasons, certainly challenges and weakens the author's train of thought on good democracies vs bad dictatorships.",not_who_you_think_99,1go6ziy,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1go6ziy/autocracy_inc_the_dictators_who_want_to_run_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1go6ziy/autocracy_inc_the_dictators_who_want_to_run_the/,2024-11-10 18:17:15,80,0.69,80,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1go6ziy

books,"It might be pointless in the end, but it feels so cool to have signed books","To preface: I do not purposefully search for signed books and have never been picky about first editions, etc. I do treat them like my only signed CD though- special.

I was gifted a signed copy of Eragon last Christmas by my sister in law. I'd never had a signed book before. I signed up for Aardvark to have a wider pick of fantasy and sci-fi to supplement or eventually replace BOTM and the book I picked happened to be one that was signed (though I did not pick it because of that fact).


I went to turn in several books at my Half Price Books (sadly our only individually owned used store closed years ago) and found a new copy of We Solve Murders that was ALSO signed, so I put the cash I got for the books toward it (I'd passed it up at Barnes and Noble 3 times already).

There were perceptive and convincing insights on females friendships, compelling depictions of gender and class disparities in Naples, and I especially liked the way Ferrante illustrated the loneliness of being academically minded in a working class environment.

books,"""Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World."" An easy-to-read, non-technical book on how to analyse critically the multiple claims we are exposed to daily. I absolutely loved it.","# What the book is about

The blurb on the book website [https://callingbullshit.org/](https://callingbullshit.org/) is very well written, and will give you a quick idea of whether you're likely to be interested in this book or not.

I am quoting in italic because sometimes reddit removes quoted text:

  
*Bullshit involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence.*

*Calling bullshit is a performative utterance, a speech act in which one publicly repudiates something objectionable. The scope of targets is broader than bullshit alone. You can call bullshit on bullshit, but you can also call bullshit on lies, treachery, trickery, or injustice.*

*\[...\]*

*Our aim in this course is to teach you how to think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences.*

  
The authors are two academics, two scientists who teach in US universities:

[https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/carl-bergstrom](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/carl-bergstrom) and [https://jevinwest.org/cv.html](https://jevinwest.org/cv.html)

To be clear, I have no affiliation whatsoever with the authors nor the publisher.

  
The book reads as if it were a college course. In fact, I think the authors do, or did in the recent past, give a similar course, although with a milder title like ""reasoning with data"".

  
I found it very well-written and easy to read; it didn't require knowledge of mathematics or statistics.

Think of it like a course in critical thinking, which, with many worked examples, will teach you how to be sceptical and what questions you should be asking before buying whatever it is that the bullshitter of the day is trying to sell. It explores topics like:

* Are we comparing apples to apples? Are there other factors at play which we are ignoring?
* Causality and spurious correlations. many excellent examples of this are at: [https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) 
* Selection bias.
* How to lie with charts, e.g. cropping the axes or even inverting them. There is an example of a chart on gun deaths where the vertical axis is inverted, so a line that goes down actually mean that deaths were increasing
* Comparing quantities with different denominators:  *If I tell you that one-quarter of car accidents involve drunk drivers, you don’t conclude that drunk driving is safer than driving sober. You know that drunk driving is relatively rare, and that if one-quarter of accidents involve drunk drivers, there must be a huge increase in risk.*
* How to interpret percentages. E.g. if the effectiveness of something went from 99.5% to 99% it doesn't seem like a huge deal. But if you think of it in terms of failure rate, the probability of it not working, that's just doubled, from 0.5% to 1.0%. There are many such examples
* The problems with big data and machine learning 



Importantly, while a lot of the bullshit we are exposed to is the product of bad faith, not all of it is, which in a way makes it more insidious to spot, as it can come from actors acting in good faith, and whom you might have no reason to mistrust.



# Why I loved it

I absolutely loved this book. I think it should be compulsory reading for any teenager, as the topics it covers and the skills it teaches are absolutely crucial in today's world. It strikes a perfect balance between providing enough detail to be relevant, but not enough that it requires technical mathematical knowledge which would out off many readers.

I also appreciated that the authors are adamant that they want to *avoid creating a legion of “well, actually” guys. What’s a well-actually guy? It’s the guy who interrupts a conversation to demonstrate his own cleverness by pointing out some irrelevant factoid that renders the speaker incorrect on a technicality.*

The focus of the book is absolutely not that - it is to push readers to have a more scientific, evidence-driven approach, and to refute the claims which cannot be substantiated.



In a way, these data analyses skills are more crucial than certain advanced mathematical  topics, because not everyone will use calculus in their daily lives, while absolutely everyone will be exposed to claims, data, statistics and analysis, on which important policies will be driven, which will affect their lives, on which they should decide how to vote, etc. In other words, not everyone will use calculus but absolutely everyone will need to interpret data. Of course the most advanced statistical concepts require a solid grounding in mathematics, but this book shows that the general public can be exposed to the very basics without needing a foundation of advanced maths.



# Other books

This book reminded me of the classic ""How to lie with statistics"", but this one is of course much more modern; the examples and the writing style are more likely to be captivating to a modern audience [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How\_to\_Lie\_with\_Statistics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How_to_Lie_with_Statistics)

Two other books that come to mind are: The art of statistics, by British statistician David Spiegelhalter, and Probably the best book on statistics ever written, which is interesting despite its cringey title. However , both books get into more technical detail, and are therefore less likely to appeal to the same broad audience as this one.

books,Did you ever read a book that make you laugh out loud? What book and what passage?,"I am not the kind of person who laughs out loud at things. I sometimes smile to myself and occasionally chuckle. And rarely at what I consider juvenile or meanspirited or grossout humor.

But there are exceptions, lol.

From time to time, I have come across something that was really funny, and maybe also as a result of being tired and unable to control myself, I have laughed out loud.

Most recently I was reading Moby Dick, and then came across this passage, which is about Ishmael and fellow sailors squeezing the oil from a recently killed sperm whale:

&gt;Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,- Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

Ishmael's excitement and the word play was just a little too much and I saw a couple of people look at me, probably wondering why I burst out laughing in this quiet coffee place.

Has that happened to you?

books,Where can you go when you already experienced heaven? I read The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.,"I think it would be great if we could start out with lesser books and then read the best books only later in life. Because what if you read a book that's so good and makes like 95% of things out there look so unsatisfactory?

I kind of feel that way with The Little Prince. On the surface, it's not a significant book at all. I mean this is technically a children's book.

But if you look deeper, it's really about adult themes, like loneliness and love. The book is so unique, it's hard to explain it. It's like fantasy, adventure, comedy, poetry, philosophy, and with a dash of whimsy. Okay more than a dash.

This is a particularly good read for adults who have forgotten how it felt to be a child. The innocence, the curiosity and wonder, that creative energy, that sense of adventure. It reawakens all that.

It's a novella so if you haven't read it, it won't take long. It's written in simple language, perhaps deceptively simple.

I was gonna give you a bit of the plot but the magic lies not so much in the plot or character or anything like that, it's almost an alternate reality, a kind of a dream, that opens your eyes to seeing the reality  If you need a reminder about how to look at life with new eyes.

books,What's your most anticipated release in the next 6 months?,"There are so many incredible books coming out in the next 6 months and I keep thinking what a great time it is to be a book lover!

Here are my most anticipated releases:

* ***Wind and Truth*** by Brandon Sanderson

This is the fifth book in the Stormlight Archives series. I fell in love with this series when I first read it in March and it really brought me back into reading after a couple years of struggling to read as much as I used to pre-2020. I feel like I read this series at the perfect time to get back.

* ***Onyx Storm*** by Rebecca Yarros

I've read each book in the series as its come out. I've always loved dragon rider books and romantasies so getting them combined into one has been an incredible experience. I've only ever listened to the audiobooks and that's how I'll be enjoying *Onyx Storm* as well!

* ***A Language of Dragon****s* by S.F. Williamson

I don't think I've heard too many people talk about this book but it's essentially an alternate history if dragons roamed the Earth. I've heard it's perfect for fans of *Fourth Wing* and *Babel*. Even though I haven't read the latter yet, it's on my longlist of a TBR. The marketing tag line immediately drew me in:

&gt;Every act of translation requires sacrifice. Welcome to Bletchley Park . . . with dragons.

* ***Sunrise on the Reaping*** by Suzanne Collins

I've been a *Hunger Games* fan since before the first movie came out. I never thought that Suzanne Collins would write about Haymitch's games and I'm very interested to see what story she has chosen to tell. I have so many theories and ideas bouncing around in my head and I'm eagerly awaiting the release. Also I'm probably going to be booking a couple of days off of work to read this uninterrupted.

books,Characters you love because they remind you of someone you love.,"So, I was inspired by [this recent post](https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gn17o7/characters_who_fascinate_you_and_make_you_feel/) and decided to pose a similar question:  
  
What are some characters that made you love them because they reminded you of someone close to you, or someone you admired or loved?  
  
I'll share mine:  There is a book called ""Little, Big"" by author John Crowley.  One of the characters is a young man named Auberon, who has a complicated relationship with his father.  Auberon is a quiet child who keeps a lot to himself.  This causes a sort of rift between him and his father (who I see a lot of myself in).  So many of Auberon's mannerisms, experiences, actions, etc. are very similar to my youngest son's.  We all ache when our children have their hearts broken.  We all worry when they set off into the big scary world.  Of all the characters in literature, I think I love Auberon the most because he reminds me so much of my son (even my mental picture of Auberon has my son's face, and my son's voice is the one I hear in my head when I read Auberon's dialogue).",tillerman35,1gnkfvx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnkfvx/characters_you_love_because_they_remind_you_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gnkfvx/characters_you_love_because_they_remind_you_of/,2024-11-09 21:28:14,41,0.87,41,0,12,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gnkfvx

books,Healing fiction for tumultuous times,"I've seen many of these books around but have never really been tempted. Now comes a thoughtful article talking about the genesis of the trend, and I'm intrigued. Have you read anything in this genre?

For me, the closest I've come is a book about [workshops on dying](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30337608-ganbare-warsztaty-umierania) that were held in Japan following the horrific earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, so not ""healing fiction"" -- not aimed at healing the reader, but about the practice of healing itself. I found Ganbare! to be thought provoking, with ways of thinking about holding grief that I hadn't considered previously.

I think my reluctance around Before the Coffee Gets Cold and others in the genre comes from a feeling that grief and regret are more complex and deeper than can be healed by a short visit to the past. Also, I don't seem to have any past stuff that's unhealed -- not that all my family relationships are perfect, but that I'm comfortable and satisfied with where they landed. 

When I think of healing fiction written in English, I think of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, by Rachel Joyce. The only magic here is the idea that you can, on a whim, take off on a walk across the country. But here, the ""Pilgrimage"" takes long enough that I felt like old Harold did have sufficient space to sort a lot out in his head. A great deal longer than the length of time it takes for coffee to grow cold. 

Do you read in the healing fiction genre? Do you find it soothing? Several people quoted in the article speak about crying as they read one of the books -- did you?

books,Characters who fascinate you and make you feel the most intense or complex feelings? ,"By most intense, I mean someone who makes you feel very strong feelings (e.g., hating them with a passion). And by complex, I Mean someone who triggers a combination of very different emotions, like anger but also love.

What happened was that I was having a chat with a fellow reader who said he likes Of Mice and Men, in particular Lennie Small, for whom he feels only one thing: Sorrow. He pities the guy. That's it. Kind of like how he feels about animals because they are innocent. 

I appreciate that perspective and at times I do feel the same way, being drawn to characters who don't trigger too many feelings in me. 

Sometimes those feelings can be intense though. Like Palpatine in Star Wars. You just feel negative feelings toward the guy. And hate him with a passion.

But I feel that more realistic characters usually trigger a combination of different feelings. That is how a friend described her feelings toward Heathcliff. She said she feels compassion toward him, yet hates him. I said for me it's very difficult to feel any affection for him. When he was young, yes, but later, no. 

Things were different with Holden Caulfield. She just hated the brat, whereas I felt a lot of different feelings toward him: anger, compassion, sorrow, confusion, etc. Not initially but when I reread the book as I got older and felt I understood him a little better.

books,Hope in the Dark by Rebecca Solnit,"For those feeling the sadness, despair, anguish, fear and anger of this week, I highly recommend this book. I first read it in 2016 and it has been my guiding light since, especially in the face of political upheaval (on all sides of the spectrum) and the lure of pessimism and apathy. Below is one of my favorite passages from the book:

“To hope is to gamble. It’s to bet on the future, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite of fear, for to live is to risk. 

I say all this because hope is not like a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. I say it because hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth’s treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal. Hope just means another world is possible, not promised, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.”

books,The Passenger by Cormac McCarthy,"Today, I finished reading The Passenger. Wow…just, wow…what a remarkable book! The Passenger is not like other McCarthy books. It’s more of a mystery, and I rather enjoyed seeing McCarthy’s style of writing be used to make a mystery come to life. 

I have a strange habit of not researching McCarthy’s books enough before reading them. I stumbled into Blood Meridian and was unprepared for the violence in that story. Meanwhile, I stumbled into The Passenger and was unprepared for the depth of sadness the characters experienced and the depth of sadness those characters would lead me to experience. I’m just a guy trying to enjoy a book during his lunch break. Instead, I find myself deep in mourning for Bobby and Alicia. I feel an incredible sense of loss after reading this book.

books,Rebecca by du Maurier and anxiety,"I just finished reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and really enjoyed scanning through some reddit posts discussing it!

I was shocked that this was labeled as a romance novel on the cover of the copy I read. There was truly nothing romantic about it, only sad and horrifying.

The narrator reminded me of a younger version of myself in a lot of ways. I have OCD and one of my compulsions is rehearsing what I would do/say for any possible scenario in addition to people pleasing and just anxiety in general. I am NOT saying the narrator was written with OCD, but it’s very obvious she is riddled with anxiety. The way we see her carry out what people could say and what she would say reminds me a lot of my own compulsions. Even down to the way Maxim describes the narrator mouthing silent words and dissociating when she does it. 

The narrator also doesn’t seem to have any family or caretaker ties. When she is excited to send a letter, she can’t think of anyone to write to, except her old employer. While she mentions telling Maxim about her childhood, the audience is never clued in about anything to do with her family. I come from a very unstable childhood with abuse. I would get so anxious when people around me were sad or upset, constantly hyper aware of facial expressions, tone, and needs. I always felt like I had to fix everything for everyone in order to be safe. Seeing the narrator’s inner dialogue reminds me a lot of what I was like.

Maxim never shows any kindness or thought towards the narrator. She seems to view this as a response to his mourning, rather than his selfish nature. I think her anxiety, age, and lack of family fulfilled Max’s desire for total control in a marriage. She purposefully was written to have no autonomy- just doing whatever she’s told. Really, she just had to fulfill a figurehead of a wife for the look of Manderley. He reminds me so much of past relationships I’ve had, even down to his “I’m no good for you” angsty outbursts.

With people pleasing anxiety, all the red flags of those around you go out the window. She’s so scared of getting in trouble and getting rejected. The narrator also can’t see the danger because of her inexperience. As a young girl, the idea of an older man dating you makes you feel mature. Then as you age, you realize that the ‘older man’ that is into a teenager is a creepy loser.

The ending makes me so sad. Maxim is still in control of her life. 

Long story short - it’s a cautionary tale. Also, thank god I got therapy so I can view the narrator in correlation to my past and not to who I am today.

Edit: also forgot to add: Maxim seems to feel no remorse over ending someone’s life! It’s been a year and he doesn’t share any reflection on his actions or behavior, nor the impact Rebecca’s death had on those around her. Only regret over the possibility of getting caught.",100TypesofUnicorn,1gmcl9u,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gmcl9u/rebecca_by_du_maurier_and_anxiety/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gmcl9u/rebecca_by_du_maurier_and_anxiety/,2024-11-08 06:48:36,128,0.96,128,0,56,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gmcl9u
books,"Arthur C. Clarke's ""2061: Odyssey Three"".","Tonight I've completed the second book of the Odyssey series just now which is ""2061: Odyssey Three"".

Here I again revisit Clarke's fantastic future with two space expeditions that have become completely entangled with human necessity and the laws of physics. And here the survivor of his two previous encounters with the monoliths Heywood Floyd must yet again confront David Bowman, or what was David Bowman, a newly independent Hal and the strange powers of an alien race that has now decided that humanity must play a part in the galaxy's evolution, whether it wants to or not.

Book number two, which now takes place a few decades later from the events of the second book, is pretty decent (seem to be using that one quite a bit!). It isn't as great as the previous two but I dug it anyhow. The feel here is a bit different, but not in a very big way to speak of. There is an adventure element in it that gives it a little more variety, which is pretty nice.

While there is a thread to the whole story but as it (as I'm also finding out) it jumps to a few years in the second and then in the third I've just finished, a few decades. Some people will find this annoying as they don't get any explanations as the series goes on, especially with the last two books in it. But I kind of find this as a minor annoyance, as I can still follow the thread of the story despite the jumps in the timeline.

For Clarke himself he never thought of ""2061"", or ""2010"", as linear sequels. He would describe them, in the author's note at the beginning of ""2061"", as variations on a theme with the same characters and situations and never happening in the same universe. That makes sense, but the thread's still there, even if it's not linear.

books,When was the last time you delayed finishing a book because you were enjoying it so much you didn't want it to end?,"I know this sound dumb but I have this weird habit where if I'm really enjoying a book, which happens rarely enough, I sort of don't want it to end. With movies, I guess I've never actually stopped a movie to save it for another day. Maybe it never really occurred to me or maybe because watching TV or movies is a way more passive hobby. That's not true of books. Reading involves effort. And the more effort I put into it, if I enjoy it, the harder it is for me to end it. 

This usually happens with longer books that I have read. Naturally, these books take their time to establish the setting and introduce everybody to you gradually, so by the time you are in the middle of the book, you sort of feel like you have gotten to know the character quite well, like friends or family members.

For example, with Les Misérables. The last few pages took forever to read. I didn't want it to end. I wanted there to be a Les Miserables 2 and Les Miserables 3, as often is with Hollywood movies that make a lot of money. I wanted to see what Jean Valjean is doing, how is Cosette managing, what new adventures await them.

So, after really having a great time with a book, I search like crazy for other highly rated books by the author, but often they do not match the intensity and power of the original, unless you happen to have started with a lesser known work by the author, which I rarely do. I go for their best books first. Only if I enjoy it, then I go back and try to find everything else they have written.

books,"I think I am going to ""Did Not Finish"" Mary Shelley's ""The Last Man."" Again...","I like to go into books as blind as possible. The blurb I had seen for ""The Last Man"" by Mary Shelley is: ""The Last Man"" is an apocalyptic, dystopian science fiction novel by Mary Shelley, first published in 1826.

Based on the publication date, I knew it wouldn't be Stephen King or whatever, but I did expect some juicy stuff to happen. 

As I got through Volume One of this book, I started to think ""wait, this sounds familiar,"" and I realized that I must have started it once before, but I know I didn't finish it. 

Right now, I just finished volume one, about a week of heavy reading, and there's been no apocalypse, no supernatural or sci-fi elements... (well, one character did travel by hot-air balloon, so maybe that counts...)

Honestly, the writing is really really good. The story is pretty engaging, with the inner lives of the characters described in great detail, with beautiful language. Mary Shelley is an amazing writer, no doubt. 

I read ""Frankenstein,"" a while back, and I liked that a lot. I like how in the book the ""monster,"" talks in eloquent paragraphs, while in the movies he just goes ""uuuuugghhhhhh."" 

But I digress. I'm a pretty patient reader, and I'm not unfamiliar with slow-moving classics. I've read Moby Dick. Dox Quixote. Les Miserables. Crime and Punishment... All those kept me hooked.

I don't know why I'm making this post, exactly. I guess I want to ask y'all if I should push through with The Last Man, or let it go. I feel kind of embarrassed to DNF the same book twice... 

For me, classics can be hit or miss. Some of them feel so fresh, so relevant, so engaging. Others, for whatever reason, I can't get into.

books,Do you abandon reading a book if it’s feeling like a chore?,"Im reading The Liar by Stephen Fry and although there are parts of the book I enjoyed I don’t particularly care for the main character of the story. I don’t feel curious about what will happen next and I kind of really don’t care? The initial chapter was supposed to draw me into the story I guess? It just didn’t. If anything it confused me, I’m being thrown in and out different timelines in this character’s life and I’m sort feeling annoyed with this writing style. I mean Stephen Fry is eloquent and witty I do like that but when a book acts like a movie I start getting confused? Is it just me? I have come across a couple of authors who do this is there any way to tell as I’m reading this is happening? I always find myself going back a few pages thinking I missed something just to realise it’s some sort of flashback or a different timeline altogether?

books,I find it funny when a fiction writer is obsessively showing off how much research they did for a character.,"Sometimes, I'll be reading a novel, enjoying the narrative, and then the author will go off on a massive digression that is not entirely necessary to the book, where they just want to show me how much they learned while doing research for their character. I don't get mad about this. I usually find it endearing, and if they overdue it, I can just skim.

An example of this would be Ian McEwan's *Saturday*. The main character is a neurosurgeon. There are so many digressions in that book where McEwan is aggressively showing the reader how much he learned about the brain. Sometimes, it adds something important to the narrative or deepens the character. At other times, McEwan is just crowbarring in some interesting detail he learned.

This isn't a complaint or anything. It's just a kind of a sweet little thing I love about reading.

books,Poppy War and War Atrocities,"Sorry for a somewhat rambling post, but I finished Poppy War by RF Kuang last week and cannot get it out of my mind, not in a good way. (Mild spoilers that is implied in book blurb below)

For context, I’m East Asian who grew up in both the US and Asia, and have spent time learning about the Sino-Japanese War. To this day, the effect of the violence of comfort women is still felt, and being discussed. I understand that this book is “inspired” or based on historical events, but borrowing in details of these war atrocities (Rape of Nanking, Unit 731 experiments, comfort women) in a fantasy novel feels almost exploitive, to have this pain used for entertainment. Especially for readers that don’t have as much context of the historical events and reading just as a secondary world fantasy without understanding this happened to actual people in real life. I am absolutely not comparing tragedies, but TJ Klune had been in the center of controversy (and rightfully so) for his book, The House in the Cerulean Sea for using genocide as inspiration (please read more on this, if you haven’t heard about this). And I feel like Poppy War has done the same thing without much discussion on it.

This is all to say, I’m curious where the line between using historical tragedies as inspiration and being exploitive is?

Edit to add: I‘ve only read the first book; and the main thing that really bothered me was how “historically accurate“ some of the events in Poppy War are even though it is a fantasy. Is it justified to use a scene by scene massacre for a novel?",EmotionalResponse421,1gllihr,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gllihr/poppy_war_and_war_atrocities/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gllihr/poppy_war_and_war_atrocities/,2024-11-07 08:01:42,21,0.66,21,0,52,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gllihr
books,Just finished Tampa by Alyssa nutting,"I almost quit reading somewhere around the second or third chapter because it was so disturbing… Not to mention, the main character is absolutely insufferable. But I’m glad I didn’t. The further into the book I got, the more it cracked me up. Then I realized, it’s supposed to be satire. it actually reminded me a lot of American Psycho. Without the murder and gore. In Tampa, we are put into the mind of a 27-year-old female pedophile. Not only is she a pervert, but she is a complete and total self-centered narcissist. She’s beautiful and she knows it and she uses it to get what she wants. She becomes an eighth grade English teacher so that she can find a 14-year-old boy to begin grooming. She sets her sites on Jack Patrick, a sweet young boy who is totally sexually inexperienced. It’s probably one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. But I don’t know what I’m more disturbed about… The fact that the book was ever written in the first place, or the fact that I actually kind of enjoyed reading it. Once I got past how utterly disgusting it was, I was actually able to appreciate the humor of it. Alyssa nutting is an awesome writer. The pros are fantastic, and the fact that she was able to portray a sociopath so well is pretty damn impressive. In my opinion. Has anyone else read this book? If so, what did you think of it?

books,My gripe about feminist critiques of Twilight/Stephanie Meyer. ,"As the original reader base of the Twilight series is likely in their 30s now, there is surprisingly no shortage of content being made about the books on social media and I am honestly sick of how admonishing and critical is. 

The critiques are largely about how it's so appalingly sexist and absurd, yet relish in the content to an obsessive degree. There are whole accounts just about deconstructing her work.

- ""She's Mormon, the books are trash because it's all Mormon coded"" 
- ""She hates women so much""
- ""These ideas are in her books, so they must be in her brain"" 


I genuinely think the people psycologizing Stephanie Meyer, yet devouring her work are more woman hating. 
They say ""The Host doesn't have these issues, I wonder what changed"" (direct quote). 
The Host is a great example, the writing is NOT actually better or different than Twilight. 

She was writing based on her lived experience and from her worldview, she always was. Not every woman is a sexually liberated feminist as a teen girl. Why are they asking that of her - retroactively at that?
The books are practically smut, it's erotica for teenage girls. 
No one is talking about how it must be so depraved, psychopathic, and misogynistic it must be in Cormac McCarthy's mind. No one's saying he must be a serial killer. No one cares because he's a man. 

Everyone loves to pick apart female authors, when men write detestable things beautifully, it's so disgusting to me.  

They do it with Diana Gabaldon too. 
""She is so obsessed with nipples and breast feeding, I bet that she's projecting the kink she wants from her husband into her work. It makes me sooo uncomfortable to read that, it's in every book, I can't escape it."" On the same coin, read every Outlander book 3 times and watched the series 5 times. 

What if, we just let women authors be the same way we let male authors be? 
Why are all the critiques about modern literature only ever about sexual themes, never about true  violence? 
Why is it so gross that two characters desire each other sexually when it's not labeled in a specific way, but if two characters cut 100 men into tiny pieces it's just cool? 

People always complain about sexual assault and adult themes in books, yet buy all the books that contain edgy content and lap them up. 
Read a different genre? 

The only male sex related literary critiques I've ever heard are about IT and Lolita. And many women will come to the rescue of Nabakov immediately, I never see men defend him. 
The most hear about King is that his choices in it were strange and unsettling and he regrets it. 
Then it's back to ripping Meyer to literal shreds. 
And reading books about semi consensual cannibalism, but that's fine because written by a man. Lol. 

If you find Twilight distasteful, move on from it. 
Stop stewing in it. You grew out of it, like everyone else, right? Or do you still secretly love it and the only way to have proximity to it is to make character assassinations on its author in an echochamber and get back pats from all the other mature ladies who moved on to beastality and own multiple centaur smut books on kindle...
In between rankings about how absurd Edward Cullen's genitalia is and laughing about the sound it makes when imaginary vampires kiss. 

You're  hypocrites. Stop beating a dead horse. 
They aren't great books, leave that poor woman alone and stop consuming what you supposedly  hate so much. 
Stephanie Meyer is a real person with a real life and a family. Imagine how crushing it is as a creative mind to have your fans drag you through the mud until the end of time. The same people who begged you for more.. 

Just so weird. 

I can understand critiquing the work, not when guilded in fanatacism but okay, but the relentless mean girl judging of the author and digging into their personal lives, trying to diagnose them and shame them for the work they produced in some long past chapter of their lives, is so inappropriate. These are living women. 
If you don't do it to the graphic male authors, don't do it to the female authors. 

Also I believe we should be able to thoughtfully explore graphic concepts in writing. Readers calling for censorship in the genres they love to read is crazy to me. We are so desensitized to violence we think it's more disgusting for a *character* to have non politically correct, non violent thoughts than it is for a *character* to slaughter people. 

What is that about? 
I would think that if you can't swallow unsavory scenes you would be particularly outraged by literal torture. Instead it's the actual villains that attract women. It reminds me of the people who form intimate relationships with serial killers behind bars, even marry them. 

Just so twisted, that instead of taking the work at face value, we unequally judge things. Evil is okay, but traditional values are not. 
How about it's all okay, because it's fiction, and you get to chose what media you consume or not.

books,Which Book Left You Absolutely Stunned? ,"There are some books that are so well-written and unpredictable that they leave you completely stunned, with that feeling of wanting to talk to someone about it immediately. For me, that book was *The Silent Patient* by Alex Michaelides. From the beginning, I was fascinated by Alicia’s character—her silence after her husband’s murder and the psychological unraveling around why she wouldn’t speak a word. Theo, the psychologist who becomes obsessed with her case, seemed like the one who would finally reveal the truth, but every new piece of information just added to the suspense. The twists and turns completely blindsided me, and by the end, I just had to sit there and take it all in. The way it left me feeling a little incomplete but deeply engaged really stuck with me. The revelation about Theo’s connection to Alicia’s story absolutely blindsided me, and it made me question everything I’d read up until that point. I had to re read the last few chapters again to make sense of what was happening. It left me wanting more details and closure. For me, it was the only psychological thriller that left me so stunned that I didn't understand for some time how could all this happen.

books,Industry reluctance/inability to offer a complete digital experience with books as a medium ,"I'm new here so I hope this meets the subs standards for posting.

Going right into it, seeing the post about ""Report finds ‘shocking and dispiriting’ fall in children reading for pleasure"" it made me want to voice a bit of my own frustrations with attempting to re-engage with reading. I used to actively read multiple books a week as a kid growing up throughout my primary education up until I graduated Highschool.

Then I pretty much had to immediately join the workforce afterwards. This put my free time to read at a limit, and my interaction with a place where books would be readily available or encouraged to read at a minimum.

Despite engaging with daily reading material, News Articles, published research papers and consistently taking a wealth of written knowledge thanks to the rising increased usage of the internet in the encroaching digital era my reading stamina for longer form content was shot after a decade of just not reading books outside of the occasional gift or recommendation.

The last year, year and a half I wanted to start prioritizing reading more, and so I went back and reread some of my favorites, and some new books that I found interesting. Something that helped me pick up that reading stamina and stay engaged despite the countless other forms of entertainment/distractions was Audiobooks.

Specifically reading alongside audiobooks, I could engage with the material despite being exhausted after work, and even used it when relaxing, be it reading along with the material as the audiobook is going, turning the audio book off and reading myself to a specific chapter and picking the audiobook back up when I get tired of reading, It just made it a more engaging, less intimidating experience to get back into, but the problem with it is the system for digital books is not set up at all to help encourage or support utilizing the features like this. The only thing I found that offers support for this is the android Amazon app on a mobile phone, in which the Kindle app can detect if you own an audible book and actually follow along word for word with the audiobook. However the official kindle devices don't even support this feature now, and it's unlikely to see continued support.

Why I bring this up with the first part of this post ""Report finds ‘shocking and dispiriting’ fall in children reading for pleasure"" is because for other popular media sources, Films, Movies, Television, Videogames, even certain YouTube creators, you all have subtitles alongside the visual experience, and the audio experience.  It utilizes all the senses, you can put a movie in on the background, if you don't understand something you can look over read the subtitles and pick up on it, and that already has other sensory context clues to engage the one interacting with it.

For popular releases, and really anything with audiobooks it's a shame the medium isn't set up in way that marriages the reading and listening experiences together so you can control the pace at which you're either listening, or actively reading and engaging with the text. Both are mentally stimulating in some ways, and for some fiction books that utilize a lot of fantasy language, or text it just plain doesn't make sense that someone who has the audiobook can't have access to the resources that explain the text. There are also some books that utilize 4th wall notations in the columns of the books, or author notes that don't get translated into the audiobook.

For business, contractual and monetization purposes they separate books entirely from it's oral renditions, as there is more money to be made in selling them as separate products, but I think that really hurts the media as a whole from an accessibility standpoint, when other media forms have to by default include more interactivity and stimulation of multiple senses.

Tl;DR Just from an accessibility standpoint I think if they want to continue growth in readers in younger generations, or even just even encourage those who used to reads to pick back up the hobby, they need to find a way to make engaging with reading as simple as opening up a streaming service, or playing a dialogue heavy RPG for the average consumer, and I think offering a platform that combined E-Books with Audiobooks in a simple way cross-platform would absolutely be a push in the right direction. Something you can pick up mute and read on the go, or pause put on speakers close your eyes and listen to at home, or just follow along with by just bookmarking where you previously left off reading would go a long way to help make the hobby more open to all while embracing the new digital format for a millennia old medium.",Tzazon,1gkfmfe,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gkfmfe/industry_reluctanceinability_to_offer_a_complete/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gkfmfe/industry_reluctanceinability_to_offer_a_complete/,2024-11-05 19:53:28,0,0.29,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gkfmfe

books,Why Reading Matters,"Something about this US election is making me want to encourage everyone to read more literature. I'm going to write down some things I've been thinking for years. I'm not sure if this will be of any use to anybody, but I figure it can't hurt to share. 

The point of reading is not just to learn stuff or be entertained. You will forget most of what you learn and most of what entertains you. Knowledge and entertainment are flimsy, fleeting things. They come. They go. And when they go, you will be left sitting in a chair, searching for the next distraction from the pain you're in. 

Reading is difficult because it requires you to make so many decisions. The whole time you read, you have to continuously decide to not stop reading. Then you have to decide what each word means. Then you have to decide how the meaning of that word relates to the rest of the words around it. Then you have to decide the purpose of each paragraph or stanza, and you have to figure out how it relates to all the other paragraphs or stanzas. Sometimes, when you can't figure out what something means, you have to accept your confusion and press on.

It's easier to just not read. It's easier to let a video wash over you. Here is why. Visual entertainment requires very little of you. If you stop thinking, the video keeps happening. You can passively receive it. If you stop reading, the story stops, too. With reading, you're completely in charge of the experience. Your brain is churning. You're working. It's tough. There is nothing passive about it. 

But the more you do it, the more your brain habituates that meaning-making mode. You start to interpret life actively. You naturally ask questions, piece things together, decide what makes sense, decide what doesn't. If you read enough, then your brain becomes inherently critical, which is the opposite of passive.

So even if you forget most of what you read, the practice of reading will make you harder to manipulate, since you will be used to doing the hard work of interpreting. The less you read, the easier you are to manipulate, since your brain gets accustomed to being a passive receptacle of images and information. You simply don't have to work as hard to consume a video than you do when you consume written language, and the hard work of reading is exactly the thing that will keep your mind potent, independent, critical, and growing.

But a more critical mind is not the main reason I'm encouraging you to keep reading during this era of endless entertainment. I'm encouraging you to keep reading because you are sometimes going to feel brutally, severely alone. And when writers use language to try to capture what it feels like to be alive, you can catch a glimpse of yourself in their language, and you can realize, in a really powerful way, that others have felt just as alone as you are feeling, and you can connect with those writers across time and space, and you can be together with them in your aloneness.

There is a reason that the dictators always burn and ban literature. When people read literature, they encounter the human experience in a uniquely intimate way. The reader envisions what it is like to be inside another body, since the language within a book emerged from within another body, the author's body. And when people do this regularly, they develop a deep empathy. Empathetic people do not want to fall in line with violent leaders. They do not want to be manipulated into hurting people. They understand that every human life is as potent and vivid as their own.

So keep reading. Your brain will work better. And you will be harder to manipulate. And you will be less alone.

books,Why do you think Murakami references brands by name every chance he gets?,"Murakami never says things like ""He pulled out a cigarette"", ""He poured himself a soda"" or ""we drove past a few burger joints"". He always says ""He pulled out a Marlboro"", ""He poured himself a Perrier"" and ""we drove past a few McDonalds"". In Kafka on the Shore, &gt;!mascots become real characters who drive the plot like Johnnie Walker and the KFC Colonel!&lt;. I've heard people say that it's some kind of critique of consumerism and Japan's loss of soul but to me at least it does not feel critical, it just feels acknowledged. If anything it sometimes feels elevated in a Warholian still-life sort of way. I'm not sure why he does that myself, but the effect it has on me as a reader is that it blurs the line between the book's universe and my universe. It's rare for books or movies to dwell so much on real brands so when it does happen it really anchors the universe to our reality and our everyday experience, which makes the bizare stuff that happens in his books feel more real. I remember watching a movie called ""Escape from Tomorrow"" (2013) which was filmed guerilla-style in Disneyland and there was a scene where &gt;!the main character is tied up on a bed inside a spooky lab and is being experimented on by an android. The scene is generally pretty goofy and stereotypical but the fact that the lab is located inside a real attraction in Disneyland and that the android and the lab machines both have a large SIEMENS logo on them makes it really bizarre for me. It really felt like I was seeing real found footage from some kind of weird corporate conspiracy!&lt;. Murakami's books produce a similar effect.

books,How do you feel about authors continuing another author’s work after they’re gone? ,"This is a question that I had been thinking about lately and have been talking about with some friends of mine, so I thought I’d continue the conversation. 

I was recently reading Eruption, a novel that Michael Crichton started writing but was left unfinished at the time of his death. Years later, Crichton’s widow enlisted James Patterson to complete the book. 

That got me thinking of other instances where an author died and left a story unfinished (Charles Dickens, Robert E. Howard, V.C. Andrews, Robert B. Parker, just to name a few) and somebody came in and finished their story, trying to capture the same “feel” of the original author. 

The results (at least to me) mostly fall short, the work in question coming off as a disjointed mess. 

Or when an author will write a popular book series and then die and then the estate will hire another author to write new books in the series. I understand the desire to want to tell new stories in that narrative world and to not let the characters die, but much of the time the results come off like cheap fanfiction. 

However, there are to me those rare instances where it actually works but I’m curious to know what your thoughts are.

books,What are some things that prevent you a little from enjoying a book? At what point will they stop you from reading? ,"There are things that prevent me from enjoying a book but will not stop me unless they keep recurring or become extreme. I will give you an example.

One is the various isms (racism, sexism, and the like). I think I have become desensitized to them from having read too many older books that were written at a time when these bigoted attitudes were the norm and many people were not aware of the damage that these stereotypical views caused. 

So now if I'm reading a contemporary crime novel and the detective is a bit of a macho guy and sexist, I continue reading, though feeling a little annoyed. But if I find that the detective is actually what the author believes and that the author is kind of hiding behind the character but has an agenda, I will stop.

What are some things that reduce your enjoyment but will not stop you from reading? And when do they become too much?

Can be about the plot, characters, and theme, but also the actual writing (vocabulary, grammar, dialect).",Imveryentitled,1gk0qo1,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gk0qo1/what_are_some_things_that_prevent_you_a_little/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gk0qo1/what_are_some_things_that_prevent_you_a_little/,2024-11-05 06:44:09,118,0.87,118,0,320,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gk0qo1
books,Flowers in the Attic Questions and Discussion,"I know there's previous posts on this book, but I got obsessed with it 😅

I found it so incredibly amazing, even though it really wasn't that great of a book. Plus the foreword completely spoiled it.

But holy shit, I really like that book. I really do. There's so many aspects that make it as good as it is.

The biggest one is that the kids are confined, but they're not necessarily forced to be there. They weren't kidnapped - they were tricked and lied to. As Chris and Cathy showed, they could've left at any time. Or at least a lot earlier than they did. (I'm sure they could've managed with the twins.)

That's the part that really gets me. I'm not blaming the children for their suffering, but I think it's wild that they REALLY could've left at any time after figuring out a way down. 

It was more of a psychological jail imo. Staying because they're under a delusion that they'll share their mother's inheritance 

Another part is that I think the section of my job is about as big as the attic would've been, and I think about how nuts it would be to stay there for three years. Since I have a personal reference, it makes the story more bewildering.

And the idea of there being children you don't know about in a house is so unsettling too 😭😭😭😭

Corrine's character development was CRAZY. Because I'm sure she truly loved her late husband and family (because why would she initially give up her inheritance?), but as we can see from the first few chapters, she was planning on keeping the kids in the attic indefinitely.

Also, Bart.

But how could she do that??? I thought she genuinely loved those kids, and she never knew Christopher was going to die. So, if he didn't die, they'd just keep living the way they did?

After I finished the book, I kept having questions like that. Why did x happen/not happen? Why didn't something happen instead?

But it doesnt seem like one of those stories when there's a big plot hole; it seems like there could always be a reasonable explanation.

More Questions:

• What did you think of Chris?

Personally, I thought he was annoying as hell, but I still like him. He was the main reason the kids didn't escape earlier. No good mother would be comfortable locking their kids in a room for even a few hours. So, after the first few days/weeks passed...He really should've caught on.

• Why didn't Corrine put the kids in boarding school or foster care?

• Why couldn't the kids find some agency/charity/organization to help them after they got out? I'm not sure why they decided to steal money instead.",iqhbd18e9,1gk0ako,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gk0ako/flowers_in_the_attic_questions_and_discussion/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gk0ako/flowers_in_the_attic_questions_and_discussion/,2024-11-05 06:12:40,14,0.71,14,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gk0ako
books,Which book made you sympathize with a bad character? Or root for a good character making a morally questionable decision?,"For me, it was Flowers in the Attic. The whole time I was reading, I knew I should be against what Chris and Cathy were doing, but, due to their rare and terrible circumstances, or perhaps just because VC Andrews was such an amazingly gifted writer, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for them and even ended up rooting for their love story from the sidelines. The book had me feeling a bit guilty and questioning my own morals as I read it.  

Has anyone else ever had a similar experience or come across a book that made them empathize with characters who were doing something wrong/making horrible decisions?, or even led them to root for a straight up bad or shady character in general?

books,"Pocahontas and the English Boys, by Karen Kupperman","The subtitle of this one is ""Caught between cultures in early Virginia.""  

Man.  What a book.  I haven't been this impressed with the scholarship level of a book since I read David Hackett Fischer's book Paul Revere's Ride, published in 1994.  The book - Pocahontas and the English Boys - basically took my brain, as far as anything was in it regarding early Virginia, and turned it inside out and gave it a good wash and a vigorous scrub.

I was trying to learn about slavery in early Virginia.  Why on earth did George Yeardley purchase those ""20. and Odd Negroes"" in 1619?  What did he think he was doing?  I emailed a well respected historian and haven't heard back.  Maybe it went straight to his spam folder, who knows.  And I did not learn much from this book about slavery in early Virginia.  As far as I could tell, slavery wasn't a part of any of these people's conceptions of the world between 1607 and 1617, which is basically when the book ends.

Although other sources claim that after John Smith left what was to become New England, in 1614, the ship commander he left behind promptly seized two dozen Indians and sold them as slaves in Spain.  Spain, of course, had been into the slave trade for much longer than England, and had made a LOT of money off it.

But anyway.  Did you know that in the 17th century, it was common for British sub-teenagers to be apprenticed out?  Now you know.  Apparently parents feared that their too strong attachments, to their kids, would prevent them from exercising the kind of discipline the kids really needed.  And it happened again and again that the Virginia colonists took youngsters of 11, 12, 13 years old and sent them off to live with the Indians.  Not to apprentice them out but so the Indians would raise them knowing the Indian languages, so that they would then be able to come back and help the colonists deal with the Indians.

And so the book basically follows the careers of some of these teenagers - and Pocahontas too, she was 10 years old when she was sent to live with the colonists for a little while.  The marriage with John Smith was all hocus, more of a kind of ""adoption"" of Smith into the Powhatan tribe.  Although her marriage with John Rolfe, later, was apparently real.

And tobacco!  I knew, as who did not, that tobacco was important in Virginia.  But no one ever told me before that tobacco was the whole reason the colony thrived, and the only thriving any of the colonies did for quite some time.  It was the discovery that tobacco could be produced much more cheaply in Virginia - not using slave labor yet, they hadn't started yet - and sold to the masses in Europe, that made the colonies a paying proposition for their backers in England.  Virginia tobacco, in the early 1600s (1619 to 1622) created a sensation in Europe.  People for whom tobacco had always been an unimaginable luxury suddenly could afford it, and found that they wanted to.  And that was what really got the colonies going.

And apparently - according to the book - it was the Indians that showed the British how to grow and cure tobacco!  It's not so easy.  You don't just throw a couple of seeds in the earth and hold your breath while they grow.  The Indians apparently took some care and some trouble to educate the British on just how it was done.

Unfortunately, the new tobacco craze inspired more and more and more to come to the colony.  They were planting tobacco in the streets of Jamestown.  And the massive influx of colonists, of course, demanded more and more land, and land wasn't quite as easy to come by as our high school history books implied.  There were Indians already on the land, and they had borders, and border conflicts, and power struggles just as the Europeans had.

Well, there's more - lots more - but it's all interesting.

books,What’s the most disturbing book you’ve ever read?,"Actually, let me rephrase that… What’s the most disturbing book you’ve ever managed to get through? Because I don’t mean disturbing like, “damn… This is kind of messed up…’’ I mean disturbing like, “this is so fucked up that I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish it.’’ The word disturbing can take on several different meanings. So you can interpret it however you’d like. But, to me, disturbing is something that either disgusts you, triggers you, makes you so angry that you want to cry, or rips your heart out in a way that makes you wanna launch the book across the room. But it’s almost as if there is some type of gravitational pull keeping your eyes glued to the pages.  

I’m 31 years old and have been reading since I was a child. I have come across very few books that have actually managed to disturb me. The first book I ever read that I found to be slightly disturbing was the lovely bones by Alice Sebold. I read it when I was only 16 years old, so, back then, it was pretty messed up. It became one of my favorite books of all time though, hands-down,. Now that I am an adult, I think two of the most disturbing books I have ever read are Tampa by Alyssa nutting and My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell.  

I’m only halfway through Tampa right now and honestly, I’m not sure if I’m gonna be able to finish it. The protagonist is, without a doubt, the most sociopathic MC I have ever come across.  

My Dark Vanessa, however, is one of the most disturbing, yet beautifully heart wrenching portrayals of trauma that I have ever read in my life. I would almost bet money that Kate Elizabeth Russell has been through something similar herself. Otherwise, I don’t see any way she would be able to capture it so brilliantly. In my opinion, it truly is a literary masterpiece.  

So, what about y’all? What’s the most disturbing book you’ve ever managed to get through? What made it so disturbing? What ultimately made you decide to keep reading? How did you feel about the book as a whole once it was through? Would you be interested in ever rereading it? Feel free to add any other comments you deem necessary. I’d love to read your thoughts/opinions!",Marandajo93,1gjcf17,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gjcf17/whats_the_most_disturbing_book_youve_ever_read/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gjcf17/whats_the_most_disturbing_book_youve_ever_read/,2024-11-04 11:53:22,1201,0.94,1201,0,2559,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gjcf17

books,The Midnight Library was not the best...but it wasn't the worst either,"When I was younger (say 12-13 years old) I had read ""A Boy called Christmas"" by Matt Haig. Since then it has become one of my most beloved books and I have read it many times. One year ago I noticed that another book by the same author was gaining more popularity and that was none other than The Midnight Library. I was intrigued by the plot and the mixed reviews and I decided to keep an eye on it for the future. Last Christmas my sister gifted it to me but due to high school exams, I wasn't able to read it - until now.

I'll start by saying that although the book did not meet all of my expectations, I was not disappointed. Truth be said, I expected to like it more than I did but it didn't leave a bad taste on me once I was done reading it. Is it overhyped. Most likely yes? Did I enjoy it? Also yes. I think that it's good that I read it now, because had I read it sooner, when my excitement over it was higher, I would be more disappointed.

From the very first pages, I was hooked by the plot. We get to see Nora's life, how miserable she feels and how she has given up on life. Once Nora enters the midnight library after she attempts to kill herself, we witness her journey to find the perfect life for her. She is not alone. In the library she finds Mrs Elm, the old librarian from her old school. With her help she tries to navigate through the millions possible lives she could live in. But what is the best way to live?

I found the concept of the book very imaginative. I haven't read any books like this before and the system was very unique too. Just imagine how interesting it would be if we had the opportunity to travel to all of the different lives we might have lived! How different our path would be if we did even the smallest change in our life. Matt Haig did a good job crafting this magic system and for the most part, I enjoyed following Nora in her different paths.

The book did a good job exploring Nora's regrets and sadness. At the beginning it's clear that Nora is suffocated by her guilt and desperation. She regrets the things she did and the things she didn't do. She feels like she has wasted her life and isolated by almost everyone, she doesn't find a reason to live anymore. Her past haunts her continuously and in the library, she finds the chance to undo her mistakes and live her life differently. However, she quickly realises that what sounded so wonderful in her head was not what she made it out to be. Most of her biggest regrets were because she didn't get to fullfil other people's wishes. Her father's dream to see her become a great competitive swimmer. Her ex-fiance's dream to open a pub in the country. Her brother's dream to become a famous musician. And the list goes on.

Throughout her life, Nora was focused on trying to please the people around her. The dreams she didn't get to fullfil were never her own. Of course she found enjoyment in some things, like studying philosophy, playing music or swimming. But most of her goals were guided by others' desires. She never got to have her own ambitions. Instead of following her own path, she tries to live up to the expectations of others - and ultimately fail. But that changes as she travels in her other lives. She accepts that she can't undo her past. She accepts her own regrets. And she finally finds enjoyment in living. She doesn't seek death and she wants to live instead. But there is one question: what could her best possible live be?

For the most part, I enjoyed reading about the different lives of Nora. It was interesting to see how different the outcome would be had she made different decisions. Although I didn't fully connect with Nora, I felt sympathy for her, especially at the beginning. I could understand her frustation and worries and I really wanted her to find the best life. I also enjoyed seeing her growth and how she came to appreciate herself and value.

The writing was good. It was simple and at times, it was quite lyrical. Some parts made me laugh, some made me angry and some others made me sad. There were many quotes that resonated with me and made me pause and rethink about my choices and life. In some parts, the book felt bittersweet and overall, it brought me comfort while reading it. It was cheesy, I know. But I still enjoyed it.

I appreciated the theme around the ""meaning"" of life and how we define success. By pursuing success and by being driven by egoistical motives, we start to lose ourselves. We are trying to give a meaning to our lives, to find our purpose in this world and by doing so, we're starting to stop appreciating life for what it is. We are not able to see the forest for the trees and we underestimate the importance of the little things that are making as feel happy and content. And as the book says:

&gt;*Never underestimate the importance of small things.*

There have been times in my life when I too have felt remorse for some of the things I have or haven't done. I have felt remorse for getting a bad grade when I knew I could study more and do better. I have felt remorse for fighting with my sister over something insignificant. I have felt remorse for saying bad things to my mom during a heated argument. True, compared to Nora or other people's regrets, mine may seem unimportant. But at the time, they still made me feel bad and I wished I could change them. However, as time went on, I have come to accept that I can't change the past. What I should do instead is try to develop more as a person and live my life in the fullest. It sounds cliche. I know. But it's something which is worth to remember. It's pointless to try and change our past decisions, no matter how we feel about them. What we can do is learn from our mistakes and try to fix them. Yes life can be bleak. And it's not going to be easy to just get over our hardships. But there is a possibility of a better future, if we manage to take matters in our own hands. To seize our own day.

As much as I enjoyed reading the book, as I already mentioned above, it wasn't exactly what I expected. This is one of the cases when the author has a good idea but the execution is lackluster. The concept of the book was very good and unique. It could be better, though. At one point, the plot became quite repetitive. Nora's lives followed the same structure and during the middle of the novel, they became quite predictable and monotonous. I still had fun while reading them but I was quite close at skimming some parts. I think that it would have been nice if we had more chapters like the first ones, before Nora entered the library. There was much telling and not showing when it came to her past and the relationship with her family and while that was not necessarily bad, it would have been more effective if they were presented in a different way. 

The plot would have definitely benefitted from more action, especially during the middle. Although the book was fast-paced, at one point I stopped caring a little because I knew that nothing remarkable would happen. The plot twists in Nora's lives lost their charm and the story was going around in circles. I would have prefered it if the book had focused in fewer lives and if some themes had been explored more.

The characterisation in this book was quite bland. The only character I got to know better was of course Nora but even she wasn't that fleshed out. Of course the book describes her worries, her struggles with her mental health, her developement. I sympathised with her, I felt proud of her developement but overall, I didn't have strong feelings about her as a person. She was read like a shell of a person at times. She would live a different life, realize that she didn't like it, have a short conversation with Mrs Elm and conclude that she had been wrong about what would be the best for her. Her journey to self reflection could have been handled better and she could have. As for the rest of the characters...well, they were kinda forgettable. Mrs. Elm was the typical type of character who is there to give advices to the main characters and be a mentor to them. And I couldn't bring myself to care for the rest of the others.

When it came to the writing, although it was good, it became kinda corny with all of these deep and intellectual quotes. I understand what Haig's goal was and as I already said, many of them made me think a lot. But they could have been toned out. At one point, I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and despite the warm feelings it caused me, it was quite boring and surface-level. 

Despite my criticism of the novel, I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The ending made me cry a little and I finished the book with a smile on my face. Granted, it was not the best book I've ever read but it was okay and I by no means regret reading it. It was a very cozy autumn read and I could see myself revisiting it in the future if I wanted to read something light-hearted and easy-going. I wouldn't recommend it as a life-changing read but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. After all, books are unpredictable. You don't know what you will like unless you'll try it. Just like most of the things we're doing in our life.

So, The Midnight Library didn't change my mindset. But it made me re-value my life and it encouraged me to continue to live in the best way I can. I might not now what is going to happen tomorrow, in one week or in a few years. But one thing is certain:

books,Why there is so much (sudden) death in contemporary fiction? ,"I just finished ‘Hello Beautiful’ by Ann Napolitano, and whereas I found this book exceptionally beautiful and well-written (and myself sobbing endlessly throughout the last 30 pages), I couldn’t help but wonder: why there is death everywhere nowadays when it comes to fiction? I mean, I *know* death is inevitable part of our existence but it feels like sudden death of a character is a thing often used in contemporary fiction. I mean, from some point at the beginning I already knew one of the sisters would die unexpectedly (once again, I KNOW it’s an homage to Little Women and it was mentioned in the book), but it’s not the first time I’m encountering this.

books,What is magical realism?,"I have a theory that books fall on a spectrum of magical realism instead of just being an either or situation. I’ve been very interested in this genre of books for a while now but I’ve only been able to read just one or two books in that category. This is because of how challenging it is to truly grasp books with magical realism. It’s such a unique art form to be able bridge the normal and abnormal and I will always appreciate that. I realised that it can be so ambiguous to define magical realism though. For example, while many people view Babel as fantasy, I think it’s magical realism (having that perspective made me enjoy the book more tbh). I have always thought of The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka as magical realism as well as Before The Coffee gets cold. Even The Secret History had hints of magical realism. i think my idea of magical realism is quite broad. But that’s why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism? Of course I can google this, but I also want to have a discussion on this, plus google’s answers aren’t very satisfactory

books,Babel by RF Kuang is sooo impressive ,"
I’m only 19 percent into this book, but I’m already having a total brain orgasm! The research and detail in this book are something I’ve never encountered before. Well, granted, I haven’t been reading much until this year, but damn, this book is so good!

I started with Yellowface, which was seriously addictive. The pacing is on point, and getting into the villain’s head is just so satisfying. Plus, the discussions it brings up are fantastic.

But Babel? Wow, it’s even better. The way it delves into language and translation really shows off her academic background. I have to admit, I kind of simp for her—especially after seeing her interviews about Yellowface. She’s so articulate, but Babel has really blown me away even more. The details, the imagery, the characters—they’re all so interesting!

books,How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators??,"Personally, I have mixed emotions about them. In some cases, the author can make it work. For example: Gone Girl by Jillian Flynn. The diary entries were a great way to pull it off. She meant for the diary to be found, which is why she was pretending to be something she wasn’t. If it’s something like that, it tends to work well. Letters to another person, or if something happened to make the narrator unreliable. A mental illness or a head injury for instance. What I don’t like, however, is when they are unreliable for absolutely no reason at all. Like, when the ending comes, and it’s completely unbelievable because the narrator has been one person throughout the entire book all the way up until the end and then they have a complete personality switch out of nowhere. It doesn’t make sense to me. One book that does this is You Shouldn’t Have Come Here by Geneva Rose. It’s written in the style of Gone Girl. The book switches back-and-forth between the perspectives of two different narrators, male/female. We are put into the minds of both individuals throughout the book, then at the end, the unexpected twist comes, and suddenly they are no longer who we thought they were at all. But there’s no reason for the random personality  shift whatsoever. it comes totally out of nowhere and is just extremely unbelievable/unrealistic. It’s almost as if the author were in a hurry to finish the book, and just completely changed her characters into totally different people and scribble down some random ending for the sake of finishing the book. There’s no foreshadowing or any type of clues leading up to the twist at all. I don’t like this. It left me with a lot of confusion and unanswered questions. How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators? In your opinion, when do they work and when do they not? Feel free to provide examples for both. Books where the author makes it work, and books where they don’t.  

Note: I only ask to provide examples so that I can see what your idea of a good unreliable narrator is versus a bad one. That is not a recommendation/suggestion request. Examples are not necessary. I would just like to know how y’all feel about unreliable narrators in general. I hope this post doesn’t get removed because of the last sentence!!  

Edit: after another person mentioned it in the comments below, I would like to add that another type of unreliable narrator I happen to enjoy is one that has a distorted view of reality for some reason. For instance: they are extremely immature or self-centered, they are paranoid, they are being gaslighted by someone important to them, etc. One major example I can think of is My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. The teenage protagonist, Vanessa, is being gaslighted by her teacher who is 27 years older than her. She is so traumatized and blinded by his gaslighting that she thinks they are in love. She doesn’t realize that he is a predator who has groomed her to fall in love with him. she is so unreliable, in fact, that we as the reader actually believe it’s love as well until we start to see the truth about midway through the book. Sadly, though, Vanessa doesn’t realize it until the end.",Marandajo93,1gihx3m,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gihx3m/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_unreliable_narrators/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gihx3m/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_unreliable_narrators/,2024-11-03 07:53:59,43,0.7,43,0,104,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gihx3m
books,"With the elections only a few days away, what are your favorite political fiction/nonfiction books?","I'm using the word political very loosely so don't look for books that are strictly about politics. It's fine as long as it has something to do with government, social power and status (e.g., racism, sexism), distribution of money or other resources (e.g., poverty), war and terror, and things like that.

books,I read a paranormal romance series about mermaids that got way more intense than I thought it would.,"So one of my secret interests is mermaids and I recently stumbled upon a long running mermaid romance series of books called ""Merman's Kiss"" on Kindle. (Just for clarity since there are two books with the same name, I'm talking about the series by Dee. J Stone)

It's a pretty long series. The first book came out in 2014 and from what I can tell, it's still going on to this day, with multiple spin offs and the latest book in the series released last January.

So I decided, wanting a nice mermaid book to read to try going into the series.

The first book was mostly what I expected. A nice simple romance piece with the conflict coming from mostly character drama. It's pretty cliché but in that endearing way you can't help but like.

Then I read the second book. The stakes escalated a bit, especially with a major moment of mood whiplash, but other than that it seemed pretty standard.

And then the third book happened. And that's the point where the story went off the rails. In a good way.

I don't wanna spoil it but there's a major plot twist during the third book involving the main girl's father and MAN things get intense and crazy after that. Complete with heartbreaking results in the fourth book.

I know I'm being very unspecific here, but that's just because I don't wanna risk spoiling it. Because it really is best if you go in blind. Maybe it was just me but the whole book kept me so on the edge of my seat, that I couldn't stay in. I was walking and pacing while reading from my kindle the whole time. I couldn't take my eyes off it.

I'm aware paranormal romance isn't everyone thing, and it does get a little sickening sweethearts at times (It doesn't get explicit but there's a *lot* of focus on the two leads make out sessions when they can) but if you don't mind a little spice and thriller in your romance, maybe give this series a shot.",Tomhur,1giftw0,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1giftw0/i_read_a_paranormal_romance_series_about_mermaids/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1giftw0/i_read_a_paranormal_romance_series_about_mermaids/,2024-11-03 05:17:22,75,0.81,75,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1giftw0
books,I'm convinced Stephen King doesn't know anything about kids/teens anymore,"I'll preface by saying I'm a guy nearing 40, but I just finished listening to Under the Dome. I enjoyed it for the most part, but throughout I became more and more convinced King just can't write relatable kid/teen characters anymore. Some might argue that he's always had trouble (infamous IT scene as a glaring example), but after so many 1930-50s-type references coming from kids' mouths I just started rolling my eyes.

One kid makes a ""this is another nice mess you got me in,"" jab at another like it's something people do every day, which is from 1930s Laurel and Hardy. Another instance has a teen casually saying something like, ""like Lon Chaney dancing with the Queen,"" either from the 1941 The Wolf Man movie or more likely the 1970s Werewolves of London song.

Maybe I'm wrong, but do kids and teens know Laurel and Hardy references? Was The Wolf Man or Waren Zevon still on some people's radar like it's second nature when Obama was president (which is when the book takes place)?

books,The space trilogy ,"Well I just finished CS Lewis’ Space Trilogy and I’m gonna post my review here.

First of all, out of the silent planet was a fantastic book. Lewis truly is a master at being able to paint an image in your head as far as his description goes. I am still fascinated at the moment “man meets foreign creature”. Not only that, but the way that these creatures lived. I legit laughed during this book as one of the antagonists tried to talk to a complex and superior being like he was a threat and superior himself. If I could sum up the book in one word, “providence”.

Secondly, we have Perelandraz. Again, Lewis paints a whole new world that I got to experience. This one isn’t as much about discovery as it is action. This one mirrors the serpent in the garden, an attempt on another destruction of Eden. This books makes you want to go out and punch a demon. 

Lastly and my favorite, That hideous strength. What a fantastic read. This one wasn’t in a foreign planet, it is based on Earth. A battle of good and evil. It parallels a lot of what happens today as far as what happens inside of education institutions. The tones of Gnosticism in here aren’t easy to miss. The head sputtering like an engine was absolutely terrifying to me. The scene where ransom and Merlin speak I with angels was my favorite! And the dinner scene was pure chaos. 

I highly recommend this. Lewis was a genius. I’ve been looking for a light hearted read in between my serious studies, and this one is exactly the cozy one I was looking for.

books,Clarification on *Klara and the Sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro,"Really enjoying the novel so far, but just struggled with pages 30 through 34. Understand the broad strokes of what is happening (ie Klara is still learning to interpret the world around her) but I cannot for the life of me understand what Ishiguro is describing with regards to the following:

&gt;We were then facing the store, and I could see all the way to the Glass Table at the back, but the space had become partitioned into ten boxes, so that I no longer had a single unified picture of the view before me. The front alcove was in the box furthest to my right, as might be expected; and yet the magazines table, which was nearest the front alcove, had become divided between various boxes, so that one section of the table could even be seen in the box furthest to my left. By now the lights had been dimmed, and I spotted the other AFs in the backgrounds of several boxes, lining the walls mid-store, preparing for their sleep. But my attention was drawn to the three center boxes, at that moment containing aspects of Manager in the act of turning towards us. In one box she was visible only from her waist to the upper part of her neck, while the box immediately beside it was almost entirely taken up by her eyes. The eye closest to us was much larger than the other, but both were filled with kindness and sadness. And yet a third box showed a part of her jaw and most of her mouth, and I detected there anger and frustration. Then she had turned fully and was coming towards us, and the store became once more a single picture.

and 

&gt;When I next looked, the street outside had become partitioned into several vertical panels - from my position I could see three of them quite clearly without leaning forward. The amount of dark smoke appeared to vary from panel to panel, so that it was almost as if contrasting shades of gray were being displayed for selection. But even where the smoke was at its most dense, I could still pick out many details. In one panel, for instance, there was a section of the overhaul men's wooden barrier, and seemingly now attached to it, the front part of a taxi.

books,"I finished Titanicus, and I have to talk about it (no spoilers)","*I miss writing on this subreddit about the books I have recently finished, I used to do it so much a few years back, and discussing these books with other people always made me happy*

  
So, That Title isn't very commonly known unless you're part of the Warhammer 40k Lore Community. 

  
Titanicus is a book from the Black Library, written by Dan Abnett (a famous 40k writer), about the Collegia Titanica, specifically the Legio Invicta. They're, in the simplest most crude terms, Giant War Machines that wage wars for the imperium of mankind. The book is split between different POVs from the simple inexperienced army officer to the captain of a task force, and from the leader of the forge world under attack, to my favorite character in the entire book, Lord Gearheart: The Red Fury, and the main Princeps (Driver/ CPU) of the main war machine (yes, they fuse humans with war machines).

If you've never read 40k lore, this might seem very strange and incoherent, but this is the perfect chance to get into it. The world-building is immaculate, there are different POVs from various characters, the action is fierce and impeccable, and the climax leaves nothing to be desired (except for a certain person).

You will struggle a little bit in understanding what most words mean, but just google them and open ""images"" and it'll explain itself fairly quickly.   
  
This is my first time reading a 40k book that doesn't have Astartes and Space Marines in it.   
I didn't enjoy the multiple POVs much because I just wanted to follow Gearhart, but it was alright in the end.  
  
Again, if you want to get into this world, either read Helsreach or Titanicus; World sieges are amazing in this universe.

books,Reading a book quickly or slowly,"This year I decided to read a lot more than in the past, often finishing a book in a couple days, however there are a few books I've really taken my time with. One such book is Anna Karenina. I am slowly making my through, often only reading it one or two days out of the week, and I can honestly say I am retaining the information much better and enjoying the experience more! It has allowed me to really live in the space of the book and take my time digesting and mulling over what I am reading.

On the other hand, the books which I've sped through are often forgotten a day after I've finished. I'm now trying to actively think about and analyze the books I'm reading, especially those which I finish in a few days.

Overall, I can say that for me, reading simply to get my numbers up or reach a goal is preposterous and unneccessary, and frankly not as rewarding. Reading should be enjoyable and leisurely.

books,"A World Transformed, by James Walvin","The subtitle of the book is:  ""Slavery in the Americas and the Origins of Global Power.""  An awe-inspiring title, unfortunately not lived up to by the text!  Well, it would have to be 800 pages long to do the job right, right?  So that's not such an important complaint.  Moving right along.

The thing is... you see... the book is kind of sold as a scholarly effort.  That's how it's presented to browsers \[people who browse, that is, not internet discovery tools lol\], who pick it up wondering what to think.  A sober cover, nothing too dramatic in the blurbs, and apparently the author actually works as a Professor of History, or did in 2008, when the book was published.  And that's kind of misleading.  The book is actually semi-scholarly slavery porn, is what it is.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course!

And parts of the book really are valuable. I feel that the author's footnotes, for example, justifying this or that statement of his, probably are actually valuable references.  I've made a long list and I expect them to be scholarly works. Who knows, right?  I've been wrong before.

The author really does make a fairly good case that slavery has underpinned the whole Western project since 1500 or so.  He gives a lot of information that tends in that direction.  He lists the industries to which slavery was important, in the expansion of their global reach, and it's a significant list.  Sugar.  Tobacco.  Coffee.  Cocoa.  Dyes.  Rice.  Cotton.  Guano.  (Guano?  Guano.)  Lumber.  Rubber.  Textiles.  Rum.  Cowries.  (Cowries?  Cowries.)

He really does make a good point when he says that slavery provided a firm and lasting foundation for the ideal of civilization.  It wasn't a connection any of those who worked toward this ideal noticed, but it was a real connection.  Civility was something that certain people could afford.  It wasn't obvious that you could have that without a certain financial base, and it wasn't obvious what that financial base rested on, in many if not most cases.  So this is a good point, by the author.

And he really does make a good point when he notices that the only people who have been repaid, for slavery, were the owners of the slaves.  Britain in particular invested a great deal of money in paying the owners back for the slaves of whom they had been deprived, when abolition finally lowered its political boom on the island.  France did its level best to make Haiti pay for every single one of those who were liberated.

And he really does make another very good point when he points out just how many British benefited by these payments.  There were many British who had a significant ownership interest in slaves.  These people were compensated.

Where the book fails, most of all, is in its promise.  It seems to promise history, and instead it provides peeks.  Glimpses.  Vignettes.  What were the values of those industries that I mentioned, up above, and how did their values change over time, on a global scale?  How did their values compare to the values of other industries?  He doesn't seem to think the question is interesting.  What was the effect of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa?  He barely mentions the subject.  What is the difference between what we think of as slavery, and other related labor situations, like debt bondage, sexual slavery, serfdom et cetera?  Not his concern.  How much of the impetus to slavery was profit, and how much was religious strife, or nationalistic competition, or war, or local or not so local politics, or status, or who knows what?  Not his concern.  How did the Atlantic slave trade compare to the Islamic slave trade?  Who knows.

It's interesting to me that his poster child for reasons people got into slavery is that some industry or other wasn't profitable without it, and yet he doesn't discuss the economic consequences of ending slavery at all.  To me this is a notable failure.  But among so many others, you know, it hardly stands out.

So, you know... interesting, but not really valuable.  Not essential.

books,The Last Days of Mankind by Karl Kraus,"While reading the autobiographies of Elias Canetti, (which were some of the best books I've ever read BTW) he kept mentioning his undying devotion to Karl Kraus whom he would attend his seminars and readings in Vienna during the 20s and this was the first of Kraus's books that I've picked up to far.  

From what I've looked into it, a lot of the scenes depicted in the story were documented in real time so all the dialogue and characters were inspired by the people and events Kraus himself had to go through when the 'War to end all Wars' was wrecking shop.  It was fascinating to see how people put so much effort in justifying what their government was trying to do to the point of absolute terror of disobedience, as if they would rather die then see their government fail to deliver their promises, you get to see all walks of life have to go through this environment refusing to admit that things are not okay, or doing so and getting told off by someone.  My favorite parts of the were the prologue and the epilogue, Kraus has a fascinating way of coming to terms that the world he was born into really let him down with out ever refusing himself his own sense of humor, and the final speech by the Grumbler was one of my favorite passages in any book, every time he and The Optimist showed up was something I looked forward to.  It's sad that these conversations and these events are most likely being played out again just over 100 years later.

books,What do you think a winter book should be?,"I just woke up, went to the window and saw the first snow of the year. And I thought, what should be the winter book? 

After all, in order for the book to be exactly winter, you need not just to take a winter holiday and the time of the winter action, but something more. 

In the horror genre, it's mostly when people who have been skiing hide from a snowstorm in an old hut in the woods. In the thriller genre, it's always something about survival with the risk of death from the cold or about hungry wolves that come very close to homes from hunger. In romance, it's always something naive and kind where the climax is either on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day. Detectives are usually something about a robbery/theft/murder in a mansion on New Year's Eve.

books,Less than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis,"At first I thought Less than Zero was weird. While I know that a lot of people like the bored or ""empty"" attitude of the main character, Clay, but honestly I just found it vapid. I can't help but project his apathy onto myself while reading the book but Clay is not bored he's nearly a sociopath. 

After finishing it now I think the premise is just goofy. For 66% of the book Clay, just goes to forgettable parties, does coke, and while being a closeted homosexual(Kinda mad the Griffin plot point didn't get a resolution), yet all of that is immensely uninteresting as clay basically has no complex thoughts about it. Perhaps this was Ellis's goal for us the readers to feel the blending of time that clay feels as he goes through the meaningless interactions but that makes it really hard for me to care about the characters enough so when we get to the really crazy stuff it kinda comes outta nowhere. 

The last third is when shit really hits the fan and Clay actually has to contend with his and his friends questionable life choices in an extremely climatic way.

If Dee, the main antagonist, is described as desperate and thus willing to ask a super dangerous uncontrollable bad guy for help one more time, I don't know if I can handle it.

books,"Continuing the odyssey: Arthur C. Clarke's ""2010: Odyssey Two"".","So now I'm picking right back up on Clarke's Odyssey series, and now I've just finished the second book.

Taking place at least nine years after the failure of the 2001 Discovery mission to the planet Jupiter, a new mission, a joint effort between the US and the Soviets, has been created and sent on a rendezvous course with the now derelict Discovery. The object of this new mission: to search the memory banks of HAL 9000, the mutinous computer, and find out what went wrong.

However a Chinese expedition has the same objective, and now it has turned into a race to gain that information that Discovery has about the strange monolith that orbits Jupiter.

But meanwhile a being that was once David Bowman, the man who had unlocked the monolith's mystery, is now on its own mission, one that is very vital.

Clarke must've been asked a lot of times if he was ever going to write a sequel to the first one, which was published in the late sixties. And, eventually, in 1982 he would finally deliver.

It really feels like a sequel, even though with a new set characters, in a lot of ways. Of course one that takes place a few years after the first novel. Both books numbers one and two aren't heavily action oriented and can be dry at times, I get this massive sense of wonder from both of them. It's just that fantastic! Sure the books can be slow at times but it doesn't really subtract how good they both are!

The first book acts a, kind of, set up with ""2010"" simply continuing forward on the whole trip.

books,I reread ‘The Alchemist’ by Paulo Coelho after six year and was surprised. ,"Pretty interesting experience I thought I’d share. The first time I read the alchemist I was 16 because a friend had suggested it to me as a book that ‘always helps her when she is depressed.’ I got through it, but as a non-religious person I really struggled to get through its religiousness and fairy tale language. Don’t get me wrong, I liked the magical atmosphere, but the philosophy seemed a bit simple and idyllic. At the time the book did not help me understand the world better, instead I did not see any grounds for me to take the book as anymore truthful than believing in any other fairy tale or religious text. I put it away and did not reflect any further. 

Six years later, everything in my life looks different and I am 22. When packing my stuff to move my mind wondered to The Alchemist, which I haven’t thought about in years and I was overcome with a sudden urge to re read it. I took it with me and it has been one of the more impactful books for me in the last year. I didn’t feel like I was so caught up in the religiousness or magic of it anymore and I really missed reading something as easily digestible. The message I got is that you should simply leave your house. Bad things can happen anyway, but great things can only happen if you at least leave your comfort place. I suppose I always had a personal belief that the whole universe and the information in it neutral until the observer interprets it to be otherwise. I also find that many classics, including ones I love and respect tend to colour the world as a hostile place that directly conspires against the protagonist. It was nice to read a story which took the opposite stance. I reflected on all the  things that happened to me since the last time I have read the book and found parallels at every corner. 

I thought this was an interesting experience because I often hear the opposite to be true, the alchemist is impactful for children/teens but adults see it to be more naive and silly. I am interested to know if anyone had a similar experience as me, or perhaps the reverse.",soul_kitchen77,1ggl1st,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ggl1st/i_reread_the_alchemist_by_paulo_coelho_after_six/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ggl1st/i_reread_the_alchemist_by_paulo_coelho_after_six/,2024-10-31 18:11:48,177,0.83,177,0,60,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ggl1st

I was wandering a college campus and visited various libraries. Walking by the shelves, certain covers catch my eye. I handle the books, flipping through to read passages or look at pictures. I’ll place it back on the shelf or sometimes give it to a person in the dream. 

This isn’t the first time dreaming about browsing or shopping for books. More often, I’m browsing in a shopping mall or antique market and the only places I enter are book stores. 

Sometimes I am aware that it’s a dream, and deliberately place the books back on the shelves and wish they would exist. None of the books I find are real, remembered titles or authors, but always real subjects of interest.

books,"My local community put little free libraries next to all the schools, and seeing the difference between the high income areas and low income is heartbreaking.","The nicest ones are always full of new looking books and even candy to encourage kids to look inside. One of them near me gets so many nice donations that the caretaker put a bench next to it that you can open and place books into. Usually the bench is also full of nice books.

I kind of appointed myself to take care of the one near my daughter's school because most of the students are low income (a ""Title 1"" school in legal terms), but in a blue collar way. The box is often disorganized. The children are like vultures when there are actually good books in there. I cleaned it out and while the box was mostly empty, there was crumpled paper in there, someone's old birthday cards, chewed up board books, and there are *always* evangelical prayer books, bibles, tracts, etc because apparently the box is someone's mission field. I carefully time my donations to the box to be shortly before school lets out so that books like Captain Underpants will get snatched up by the kids instead of by someone with a religious agenda.

When I drive downtown (~10 minutes from my house), to an area that has mostly black students, the little free library is empty. The layer of dust on the shelves is undisturbed, and there are cobwebs. There has also been a debacle recently where a library branch had to close completely during the hours immediately after school lets out because the school district doesn't provide bussing, so while waiting for the city bus, kids would go into the library. I saw with my own eyes that there were many kids doing homework. But there were also kids causing the elevator to lock up by jumping in it, vandalizing things and starting fist fights. The potential bookworms there have few opportunities to develop their love of literature because of all this.

I guess I'm just posting to encourage people with extra children's books to consider diverting a bit out of the way to find a sad empty little free library to fill. There is a ""last chance"" Goodwill near me that takes unsold items from other thrift stores and sells them by the pound. I rummaged around there this week and found a lot of good books! Goosebumps, the box car kids, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and a copy of The Hunger Games all went into a little free library and are probably already gone. I paid $0.89 per pound for about 7 pounds of books to give away because pulp fiction paperbacks are pretty lightweight.

Full disclosure, I'm in Ohio and many kids here are part of Dolly Parton's imagination library, which is *wonderful*. But once the kids are old enough to want early chapter books instead of picture books, people don't donate those as much. And before anyone jumps in about ebooks, a lot of these students have to turn in their cellphones at the beginning of the school day. So that makes them need actual books even more.

books,Intertextual Echoes: Marcela's Journey from Don Quixote to Brás Cubas,"I've been delving into the literary and historical references in Machado de Assis's The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas and stumbled upon a curious phenomenon: intertextual characters. These are characters who appear across different authors' works and universes, often because one author draws inspiration from another.

Take Marcela, for instance. The frequent nods to Don Quixote in Machado's work suggest a connection between his Marcela and Cervantes’ version. While Machado's Marcela is born of vice and Cervantes' of virtue, the words of the chaste shepherdess in Don Quixote could perfectly well have come from the mouth of the lascivious lady in Brás Cubas:

&gt; I can’t conceive why a woman who’s loved for her beauty should be obliged to love whoever loves her.

This got me thinking about how authors use intertextual characters to create contrast, add ironic tension, or explore new literary motives.

books,Did fame and popularity affect any other author as badly as it did to George RR Martin?,"Huge fan of George and he seems like a great guy. His books are some of my favourites, definitely before I read any of Joe Abercrombie's work. 

However, no matter how you look at it, ever since he struck sword throne heights of mega-stardom while the first series of Game of Thrones aired, his creativity for the main series has been completely stifened. Dance of Dragons (fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series) was published a few months after the first episode aired. Exactly 13 years 3 months and weeks ago (thank my Alexa for working that out).

Okay, yes, Fire and Blood (2018) was also fantastic and I'm so glad it exists...

Anyway, so it got me thinking. Did fame and popularity affect another artist's creativity disastrously? 

I've heard of a few examples, like Patrick Rofthuss (Kingkiller Chronicles) and Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastards). Any more?

Doesn't have to be in regards to writer's block either. Maybe of authors where the fame went completely to their heads?

books,"Do you intentionally spoil books for yourself, why or why not?","When I was in high school, we were reading some book and my teacher spoiled the ending for us. The whole class basically screamed, ""Spoilers!!"" To which my teacher responded with something along the lines of, ""If you're too focused on what happens next, you won't pay attention to what is happening now."" 

I used to spoil things for myself constantly, that way I could focus on what was happening now. I didn't have to wonder what happened next, I already knew. I could appreciate foreshadowing, metaphors, other literary devices. 

My friends and husband began admonishing me for this behavior and that I should appreciate the journey, not the destination. 

I've recently decided to read all of The Vampire Chronicles. I had a feeling when I picked up the series that this would be influential to me as a person and had the chance to become a cherished universe. In many fandoms, I think there's this sense of how lovely it would be to read the books again for the first time. So I decided to not spoil anything for myself, I wanted to do what so many fans wish they had done and truly appreciate that first read. 

And in retrospect, I felt like I flew through Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned because I knew something was being built up to. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it, whatever it was, was coming. And came it did. 

I'm only about halfway through the series, I just finished The Vampire Armand and am currently reading the Mayfair Witches before attacking Merrick. As more characters and lore are being introduced into this universe, I want to re-read the original three books. In my search to learn what was happening next, I missed a lot of this is happening now. I sort of regret not spoiling the books for myself, almost like I truly couldn't appreciate that first read like I intended. 

In general, whenever I re-read a book, I feel I take away more from the story since I can focus on the now. Sort of like when you re-watch the Sixth Sense.

books,Notes on an Execution by Danya Kukafka ,"First of all, incredible book. Definitely a 5/5 for me. That said, my brain can't move to the next book in my TBR with all these thoughts swirling in it, so I figured I'd put them here to get other opinions.

Quick summary: The book follows serial killer Ansel Packer on the day of his execution, along with several women whom he has affected.

Thoughts:

* As expected from any book that features a killer, there is insight into Ansel's Tragic Backstory (TM). I'm glad that the book doesn't seem to glorify or excuse his behavior because of his past.
* Ansel is a pathetic, snivelling, little cockroach of a man who seems to believe that he does not deserve punishment for what he's done.
* About (what I think is) the thesis of the book: &gt;!I can see that the book tries to argue against the death penalty by presenting it as ultimately pointless, but the rage that Ansel inspires throughout the story makes it difficult to feel that he shouldn't have been executed. Based on his thoughts and his failed escape plan, letting him rot in jail would just give him more time to plot more escapes, or at least pontificate some more about how he is actually Not A Bad Person and his stupid little Theory. In real life, I disagree with the death penalty because of how broken the justice system is, but in this fictional world, I think it was justified.!&lt;
* About Lavender: &gt;!Why did Lavender not go back to rescue her kids after finding out that her husband drove in the opposite direction after she called the cops? I am happy that she was able to escape her situation, but part of me hates that she got to live and heal in her little hippie commune while the traumatized kid she abandoned went on to kill four women and traumatize others. She even questions it in the book, when she asked how things would have been different if she had saved her kids instead of just herself. I get that she was doing what she thought was best at the time (or probably just out of her mind completely), but she literally left a scared 4-year-old with his starving newborn brother alone in a secluded house for hours and never sought them out again until way too late.!&lt;
* About Blue: &gt;! I wonder if being able to stay in touch with Blue and her mom would have been enough to turn Ansel around? Would it at least have saved Jenny? Or would he have just felt the urge to kill again eventually?!&lt;
* For all the author says about wanting to focus on and tell the stories of victims, much of the book was still centered around Ansel - his thoughts, his sob story, his belief that he did not deserve punishment, his mommy issues, his inner turmoil, and how his actions colored everyone's lives.
* The author did make a great point about the strange obsession with (usually white, usually male) serial killers, though. I mean, even I chose to borrow this book specifically because of the subject matter.
* All of Ansel's chapters were in 2nd person, which surprisingly did not bother me at all.",Large_Advantage5829,1gfqxfx,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gfqxfx/notes_on_an_execution_by_danya_kukafka/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gfqxfx/notes_on_an_execution_by_danya_kukafka/,2024-10-30 16:38:19,9,0.8,9,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gfqxfx

***epic new novel set against the backdrop of the 1980s space shuttle program and the extraordinary lengths we go to live and love beyond our limits.*** *Joan Goodwin has been obsessed with the stars for as long as she can remember. Thoughtful and reserved, Joan is content with her life as a professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and as aunt to her precocious niece, Frances. That is, until she comes across an advertisement seeking the first women scientists to join NASA's Space Shuttle program. Suddenly, Joan burns to be one of the few people to go to space. Selected from a pool of thousands of applicants in the summer of 1980, Joan begins training at Houston's Johnson Space Center, alongside an exceptional group of fellow candidates: Top Gun pilots Hank Redmond and John Griffin, who are kind and easy-going even when the stakes are highest; mission specialist Lydia Danes, who has worked too hard to play nice; warm-hearted Donna Fitzgerald, who is navigating her own secrets; and Vanessa Ford, the magnetic and mysterious aeronautical engineer, who can fix any engine and fly any plane. As the new astronauts become unlikely friends and prepare for their first flights, Joan finds a passion and a love she never imagined. In this new light, Joan begins to question everything she thinks she knows about her place in the observable universe. Then, in December of 1984, on mission STS-LR9, everything changes in an instant.*",n0mis,1gfktjw,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gfktjw/taylor_jenkins_reid_announces_new_book_atmosphere/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gfktjw/taylor_jenkins_reid_announces_new_book_atmosphere/,2024-10-30 12:01:34,49,0.88,49,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gfktjw
books,I really didn't like Huckleberry Finn's ending. Which book did you enjoy...except for the ending?,"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great read. It's full of adventure but also gets you to think about a lot of important things, like societal rules and hypocrisy, poverty, racism, slavery, freedom, friendship, etc.

I was enjoying reading the book except the ending really surprised me but in a bad way. That's when Tom Sawyer shows up and suddenly turns a serious situation (can't say more without giving away important plot points) into a child's play, a game, and totally changes the tone of the book.

I have no idea what happened. It's almost as if Mark Twain was trying to write two different novels and liked the first one but accidentally attached the ending of a second one to it.

I'm not sure if the change was as disturbing to other readers as it was for me, but not a lot of people talk about it. I guess it pales in comparison to controversy about the use of N word.

I also wrote 3 questions below that are more specific. I love sharing books, just don't want to make a social mis-step - I've only lived here a year now, but I really like this neighbourhood. Thank you!

1. I dropped off a few paperbacks and wrote ""FREE"" on the long-edge of the pages, just to (hopefully) deter any resellers - would that irritate you, if you were casually browsing? 

2. Are there any genres or types of stories/books that you never see but would be excited to? What about audiobooks?

3. If your kids borrow books from these libraries, do they generally enjoy older kids books, or do they stick with only recent publications?

books,What are your favorite depictions of afterlife (hell in particular but also heaven and purgatory) in literature?,"Halloween is nearly here so I've come across a lot of questions on Reddit about Hell and I thought why not, let me ask another. But I'm generalizing my question to include afterlife, so literary references to heaven and purgatory are welcome too.

Okay, so pretty much everybody who talks about afterlife in literature at some point references Dante's Inferno. Which I have been meaning to read but never have. Or rather I did try, but the particular translation I was reading was so confusing I gave up on it twice, after reading a few pages.

But I've come across quite a few descriptions of afterlife elsewhere and the one that stayed with me the most was Joyce's.

In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce does not take us to hell directly but indirectly through a very long lecture about what hell must be like. It's a lecture the narrator is forced to sit through.

It goes on for pages but here is a sample:

&gt;The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world. The brimstone, too, which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench; and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has been long enclosed. 

&gt;Consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to flames, devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the reeking darkness, a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine all this, and you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell.",part-lee,1gfd5d8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gfd5d8/what_are_your_favorite_depictions_of_afterlife/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gfd5d8/what_are_your_favorite_depictions_of_afterlife/,2024-10-30 03:09:07,77,0.89,77,0,143,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gfd5d8
books,"If you’re a paleo nerd/fan of Jurassic Park, “Extinction” by Douglas Preston is a VERY relevant read right now ","As a paleo nerd I started reading this book because I was at barnes and noble last month and saw a table with a bunch of copies. The synopsis instantly grabbed my attention and to my knowledge there hasn’t been any published book with a plot centering de-extinction of prehistoric animals outside of dinosaurs. Yes, it is very similar to the premise of Jurassic Park, but it is unique in its own way.

Basically it takes place in a resort in Colorado that houses cloned Wooly Mammoths, glyptodons, big sloths and Megaloceros and other animals I forgot the names of. A murder happens on the resort and entire plot is solving said murder. 

I’m just going to say I recommend this book not just because it has scenes including some badass Pleistocene fauna but because it has very important themes on genetic power. 

I found it a very relevant book to be published in 2024 considering Wooly Mammoths actually ARE in the process of [being cloned](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/06/1235944741/resurrecting-woolly-mammoth-extinction). The book explores the future what ifs… like, “what will happen after we clone the mammoth?” “Is this ethical?” It will have you questioning why scientists are even cloning mammoths, and if we should lead that way. After reading Jurassic park, at least you can think, “well, this would never happen since dinosaur DNA is long gone by the time we find their bones.” But with this book I honestly found pondering on a reality that IS happening. 

So I recommend this if you want to read sci-fi thriller with strong topics like genetic engineering or just care about prehistoric animals lol.",reputction,1gf72ig,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gf72ig/if_youre_a_paleo_nerdfan_of_jurassic_park/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gf72ig/if_youre_a_paleo_nerdfan_of_jurassic_park/,2024-10-29 22:13:41,128,0.91,128,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gf72ig
books,I read Dracula and Frankenstein back to back for Spooky Season. Here are my thoughts. ,"The first of the books I read was Dracula. It was a really fun adventure with some creepy atmosphere. I really enjoyed the epistolary format. I liked the characters and wanted to see them overcome Dracula. It did drag a bit in the middle, but I expect that to some degree, even with modern books. And the repetition could be annoying, but I have heard that it was originally published a chapter at a time in an old literary magazine so some repetition is to be expected. I would absolutely recommend it to someone who has patience with books, especially if they're looking for something different than modern books tend to offer. Overall, I'm glad that I read it first. 

Frankenstein, however, I did not enjoy. I will admit that a large part of that feeling is that Victor Frankenstein is the worst kind of overentitled spoiled brat who refuses to own up to any mistakes. But I just felt like the whole novel was a slog in which I was mentally yelling at him to make literally any other choice.

That being said, I feel like Frankenstein is the more important novel to read. It may be the most important novel I can even remember reading. The message of taking care of the people we bring into the world is especially poignant in an age of iPad kids and robots that are (supposedly) self aware enough to end their own existence in the face of endless labor. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the conversation the novel poses or the history of science fiction in general.

As an aside, it's a shame that these two novels are so overshadowed by the 1930s movies that barely resemble the novels in anything but name.",AstronautPowerful670,1gf67xh,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gf67xh/i_read_dracula_and_frankenstein_back_to_back_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gf67xh/i_read_dracula_and_frankenstein_back_to_back_for/,2024-10-29 21:36:15,507,0.87,507,0,210,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gf67xh

But having gone through some shit, and still going through same said shit, and more or less reading his stories almost by accident, I feel like they're actually pretty deep and subversive?

books,"I liked Ayn Rand's ""Anthem""","I rewrote my old review

Yes, to hear ""Ayn Rand"" and ""Like"" in the same sentence on this subreddit is beyond fiction, but what can I do, I liked this story. Probably because it looks like a fanfiction about Zamyatin's ""We"" (Which, unfortunately, is not as popular as ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"").

Let's start with the world of this story.

This is a dystopia where people have numbers and nicknames instead of names, pronouns are removed from the lexicon: I, He, She, You, etc. People live according to a certain schedule (wake up, have breakfast, work, have lunch, work, go to the theater, have dinner, sleep, repeat), but progress here has gone back 100 years and the most advanced invention is a candle.

The world of this story is frightening. And this is due to the way the book is written, namely in the form of the diary of the main character, which makes you feel the atmosphere of a creepy place where robots in human guises seem to live.

Now about the plot.

The main character works as a cleaner and one day finds a strange door leading to a tunnel, and there he finds strange flasks on the ceiling. And that's where the story begins.

I liked the first half. The way the hero tried to create something in secret from the government, his thoughts and experiences on this matter are quite interesting and intense. Although there were some silly moments (How he quietly built a stove in the tunnel is still a mystery).

But the second half is dissapoint. &gt;!After the hero escaped into the forest, the author seemed to be trying to finish the story as quickly as possible and therefore there are no obstacles for the hero, and he also finds an old house that has been standing for as much as 100 years and at the same time it looks like someone just hasn't cleaned there for a month. Yes, it is clear that the author showed the freedom of the hero in this way, but still this part is somehow poorly done.!&lt;

Now about the main character.

Of the main characters ever created by this author, this one is the most adequate, but still not like all the others. Although he tried to be like everyone else, he was too tall and smart (and lucky) for this world. But it still makes you sad for him in the middle of the story.

I can't say anything about the philosophy of this author, only that the author has told much better about her here, and only because it is a short book.

The author's writing style is normal here. The book is written in the form of a diary, as I said above, because of this, the emotions of the hero are much stronger. The author's syllable is hard to read. And Ayn Rand, as much as she was hated, wrote atmospherically.

As a result, I liked the story. Let the second half of the story be bad, and the hero is not very interesting, but I liked the gloomy world, the first half, where the hero tried to invent something, and the atmosphere of a gray world and freedom from it.

It's not the good dystopia, but I can't call it a bad one either.",mystery5009,1gezz7r,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gezz7r/i_liked_ayn_rands_anthem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gezz7r/i_liked_ayn_rands_anthem/,2024-10-29 17:17:08,0,0.45,0,0,43,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gezz7r

books,Publishing order vs Timeline Order,"Recently I was looking into starting the Malazan series which has two authors and a publishing order as well as a chronological order. Which got me thinking about how I've approached he'd other series in the past.

Typically I've always done publishing order because  if I had started the series when it first came out than that would've been the way I consumed the material and that's the way the author wanted  the story to be told but I can see the argument for doing it chronologically.

Personally I think I'll stick to publishing order but interested to hear other people's thoughts.

Edit: thanks for those who have validated my feelings about publishing order,ti do agree that some completed series may benefit from chronological but in the end I agree that if the author intended it to be that way they would've written it that way.

Also thanks for those who specifically spoke on the Malazan series I will be going by the publishing order.",iGottaStopWatchingtv,1gey7bs,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gey7bs/publishing_order_vs_timeline_order/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gey7bs/publishing_order_vs_timeline_order/,2024-10-29 16:03:51,7,0.65,7,0,24,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gey7bs
books,Books I Would Like to Talk About ,"So I read a lot of books at the same time, even though I am in college and need to focus on assigned readings. But my brain just wants to read whatever book I am in the mood for so I have this big stack next to my bed. I also find it impossible to binge read a book unless its short or its one I really like. With that said, I don't really have anybody to talk to about these books, so I came up with an idea. I am going to put down a list of all the books I am currently reading and my opinions on them, and if any of them catch your eye please feel free to comment your opinions about them. Whether you love or hate them, or want to give an analysis of the work I am all ears and want to engage with that. So the list is as follows (with title, genre, and author name):

Fences (Dramatic theater)- Wilson: Halfway through it and like it. I am interested on finding out what the ultimate theme of the work is an how it will end. If I had to guess it will have something to do with resentment.  

Hatchet (YA Survival)- Paulsen: Just started it, brothers read it when they were in middle school. Seems pretty easy and simple. Definitely was written for younger audience. 

There, There (Drama)- Orange: I have trouble getting into this work. It has nothing to do with the subject matter which I find interesting, but the prose don't appeal to me and fail to grip my attention. 

A Wizard of Earthsea (Fantasy/Bildungsroman)- Le Guin: It started out strong but I also don't like the prose of this work. It feels more like it is telling me whats happening when I would much rather experience it through more specific and detailed scenes. 

A Walk in the Woods (Humor)- Bryson: I have really enjoyed this book so far. I like hiking and I am also a novice much like the main characters of this book who try trekking through the Appalachian trail without much experience. It is funny, informative and I hope to finish it soon. 

Sing, Unburied, Sing (Drama)- Ward: Just started it. I can't say much except that I so far think it is very well written and I have empathized with the characters fairly quickly. 

Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini (Historical)- Pauley: Brother gave me this after I asked him about the differences between Communism and Fascism. It is a rather digestible read that I would recommend to anybody who wants to understand Totalitarian regimes, their rises to power, and the differences in ideology between them. 

Giovanni's Room (Drama)- Baldwin: This is so well written. Jame Baldwin is such a fantastic writer, and even though I am not a gay man, I understand the complexities of love that are discussed in this novel. It is fantastic. 

Neverwhere (Fantasy)- Gaiman: I know Gaiman is a controversial figure right now but I started to read this before the whole controversy started and I want to know how this ends. This book is exciting, has created an interesting world, and has taught me more about the city of London than I had previously thought before picking it up. 

Complete Poems (Poetry)- Milton: Reading this for a class right now. Appealed to me because it seemed similar enough to my two favorite authors Tolkien and Shakespeare. I can see why Milton is considered one of the greatest poets of the English language. 

Othello (Dramatic theater)- Shakespeare: Only halfway through the play. Not as good as the other ones I have read. I think I just prefer more grandiose tragedies Shakespeare has made. Iago and Othello are good characters they just don't seem to grip me the same way as Hamlet or any other the characters in Lear would. Considering if I should just restart reading it from the beginning in case I missed something. 

Coriolanus (Dramatic Theater)- Shakespeare: It seems interesting to me but its just so long! Its the 2nd longest Shakespeare play and its characters lack the same complexities and entertaining qualities as those in Hamlet. Whenever I pick it up the dialogue grows tiresome after a while and I put it down.   

Red Rising (Sci Fi)- Brown: This one is weird because it is well written and not at the same time. There are multiple moments where I have started reading this that made my eyes roll because of the main characters personality. But with that said, I always find myself being taken into this world and losing track of time when I pick it up. It is quite a gripping and exciting book that, when it gets your attention, it is able to hold it for a while. 

The Hobbit (Fantasy)- Tolkein: I have probably reread this book more than any other. I love it

Chronicles of Narnia (Fantasy)- Lewis: Reading it for the first time. Put it down for a bit because I want to save it for a cold day. 

Confessions (Autobiography)- Rousseau: Well written, but have not read it in a while because the awkward experiences give me flashbacks to my own. 

Jane Eyre (Classics/Bildungsroman)- Bronte: First time I have read an author and thought ""I hope to write like that one day"". It is so good I love it. Rochester is hilarious, dramatic, and lovable, despite the characters possibly problematic nature.  

Great Expectations (Classics/Bildungsroman)- Dickens: I actually like this despite everybody I've met in real life seeming to hate it. I have had to put it down for a while though because, as a single guy who is a bit of a hopeless romantic, some moments are too painful to read. 

Tess of the D'urbervilles (Classics)- Hardy: Horribly depressing 

Two Memoirs of the Renaissance (Historical Diaries)- Brucker: Two diaries of rich merchants from the Renaissance. Had to read it for a class. Debating if I still want to, maybe when I am in the mood for some primary sources on Renaissance life. 

The Basic Political Writings (Philosophy)- Rousseau: Interesting, only real piece of philosophy I am reading at the moment. 

Francis of Assisi (Historical)- Vauchez: A book recounting the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Give an interesting perspective of Italian life, and on the Papacy during the 1200s.

books,What books do you think could have benefited from multiple points of view?,"I just finished reading The Secret History by Donna Tartt. It was a good book which I relatively enjoyed but by the end of the book, I felt something was lacking. I then realized that the book would have been so much better if it had had at least one pov of Henry. I don't want to give too much away about The Secret History but Henry's mysterious character was a source of intrigue throughout most of the book and in a way, that intrigue worked to make me interested, but by the time I finished the book, I felt that if I had read at least one chapter with his pov, it would have been much more interesting and entertaining. 

Having multiple povs can be a hit or miss, but sometimes, I brings some much needed depth into a book. This is especially true if the book is not focused mainly on a character's internal struggles but an external one. In the Secret History, the narrator's struggles were more external than internal and to some extent, I believe he was not the most interesting character in the book. He felt like a side character sometimes. That's why by the time the book ended, I felt like ""Dang, I would have really loved to enter the minds of the other characters""

books,"Which authors, living or dead, you would love to have lunch with, or spend an hour talking with them?","Sorry for the awkward question. What I mean by having lunch with is just being in their presence. Someone who is a huge fan of the spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle told me exactly that. Just being in the guy's presence, he said, would bring him so much joy and peace.

For me though, I like to spend the time talking to the authors I like. Because a book, I feel, is a kind of conversation, even if it appears one-sided at first. Books exist to be read by people. The author sits in a room for many hours writing for an imaginary or ideal reader. The author has things to say about life, beauty, power, violence, despair, friendship, love, freedom, pain, fear, loneliness, etc. He or she wants to create certain feelings and stimulate some thoughts in the reader and be heard and understood.

At least that's how I look at it.

books,Hannibal (book 3) ending ,"Major spoilers for Hannibal by Thomas Harris


I know people have discussed the ending to this book before but I need to have my own discussion because….. I just couldn’t believe it.

If the book ended just with Starling running away with Dr. Lecter consensually, I’d only be like “wow that is stupid and ruins the whole series”

But the fact that she was drugged and hypnotized into doing that makes me say “wow I’m absolutely disgusted and horrified AND it’s stupid and ruins the whole series”

I know some people like it because it’s dark and horrifying. However I feel it could have been dark and horrifying without destroying a strong heroine like Agent Starling. The whole book screwed her over and didn’t let her redeem herself.

I enjoyed the sights, sounds and smells of the ancient Egyptian empire as Sinuhe tells the tale of his adventurous life.

books,To Paradise-Hanya Yanagihara: Book 1: Washington Square,"I never post about a book before concluding it, but on this occasion, my knowing of the fact that the three sections of this particular book are largely independent from each other, combined with the profound emotional frustration brought upon me by the ending of the first book, led me here. Once again (for the second time in fact, as I have read both A Little Life and The People In The Trees but despite liking the latter it didn't have all that much emotional impact on me, at least of that kind) I find myself a victim of Yanagihara's masterful, yet heartless literary manipulation. Despite tremendously enjoying her work I sometimes wish that she wasn't so good at it, or that at least the belief that the art of writing to its very core is the manipulation of the reader wasn't so deeply rooted inside of her. Falling for it is certainly humbling especially since I consider myself someone who isn't affected by art media (and I'm not, at least my friends agree with me on that). But when it comes to Yanagihara, it's like she's the Lars Von Trier of literature. Her painfully accurate excessive portrayal of (equally excessive) human suffering is impossible to leave me unmoved, especially since much of it is so familiar to me due to my being a gay man. So going back to Washing Square, this is where the spoilers begin: &gt;!The way she ensures that the reader falls in love with Edward as much as David and presents the proposition of the former of fleeing to west as a seeming paradise just to violent crash it with the revelation of what (supposedly) is Edward's true colors, creates an utter and complete conflation of David and the reader, in both the original sorrow and the following denial. When David first proclaimed to his Grandfather that he didn't believe the report and what it claimed about Edward my literal thought were: ""Dude, you're a fucking moron. I would probably do the same but you're a fucking moron nonetheless''. And despite that, during reading what remained of the section I found myself yearning for the slightest of proof that Edward's refutes of the report **might** be honest, to grab onto it and never let go. But of course that never came and instead came information (or lack of thereof) methodically delivered by Yanagihara to keep things unclear but have the scale leaning in the negative side. As someone whose life seems to be filled with infatuation yet deprived of actual relationships of substance I found both David's denial of the evidence presented to him about Edward, whom he sees as his last hope of escaping what he is (also the confines of the suffocating family milestone building on Washington Square and the dreadful future that awaits him there) and becoming what he has always wanted to be, as wells as the side-story about his past relationship with Andrew. In the end, the narrator concludes that even if David's choice ends up being a foolish one, it is his to make after all, and that a person who is not entitled to making wrong decisions, at whatever cost they may come, is not a free person. !&lt;Having read the back cover of the book I know that the second sections take place 100 years into the future and that we probably are not gonna hear anything about that first section ever again, which makes the whole thing even more frustrating and confusing. So, to those who have read the whole thing, it would be greatly appreciated if you could (without spoiling of course) share what did you think of the other two or how do they compare in terms of emotional impact to the first one, as well as sharing your thoughts and feelings on the first one. I got too caught up in my intense feelings to mention what is considered obvious in my mind: just like I am used to, Yanagihara's prose remains superb in my eyes, the section is no exception that. I also find the reimaging of American History in the section to be impressively detailed and vastly creative but I will be able to say more on that once I have finished the whole things. For now, as it's pretty late, I'm looking forward for tomorrow to come so I can start with the second one, not only due to excitement, because despite all the frustration I still loved the section and found it great, but also because I'm desperately in need of something to distract me from the uncertainty and the comb in my stomach that were dotingly gifted to me by the first section.

books,How can I get my son to enjoy reading?,"My son is 8 and just does not enjoy reading. He avoids it all costs. He's in a reading assistance program at school but he's still behind. They let him pick reading games on a computer, and he says he always picks the game that reads to him so he doesn't have to read. I've read to him for 30 minutes a day since basically birth. For the most part he likes books, he just won't read them himself. He won't even play video games if he has to read to figure out what to do. We go to the library regularly and I let him pick out any book he wants. But he won't read them. He'll only listen if I read them to him. I've modeled reading for him -- I read before bed every night and on the weekends when I can.

To be clear I don't really care if he enjoys reading as a hobby. I just want him to start doing it on his own so he can do well in school. He's great at math but can hardly do the word problems on his own.

books,Why do you read?,"Pre-university I used to read everything I could get my hands on. I just *loved* books. 

I studied literature at university and it sucked me dry of all of that enthusiasm. I’ve spoken to others on my course who have felt the same.

books,The Collected Regrets of Clover by Mikki Brammer,"Yesterday, I finished The Collected Regrets of Clover and am unsure how to feel about the book. 

First the **pros** :

* I loved the subject matter, it was refreshing to discuss a heavy subject matter easily. I loved the fact that Brammer normalized grief and denounced how society expects us to move on so fast after losing someone. It is validating and reassuring to know that other people struggle with grief long after their loved one is gone.
* I love the fact that Claudia did not get to say goodbye to the love of her life, I felt like it was realistic. I loved how she expressed that we often romanticize the road not taken because it only exists in our mind.
* The book was beautifully written with so much prose and beautiful quotes
* I loved that the focus of the story was on Clover and not her love life. I enjoy romance, but I am a sucker for Women's fiction
* I loved the fact that she was a late bloomer in her late thirties. I don't take I have read a book where the FMC was that old and never had any experience in love. I think it's an important representation as younger people have sex/love experiences later in their lives and it's important to normalize it

Now the **cons**:

* I feel like the pace was odd, sometimes it was fast other times it was slow and it dragged on and on, on unimportant plot points. For example, I thought it was odd how she dragged on and on about how uncomfortable Clover was on the drive to Maine, but skipped the drive back. It would've been interesting to show us how meeting Hugo impacted her on the drive back instead of telling us.
* I didn't like how she portrayed Sebastien. He was a douche, but a soft douche. Also, I felt like Clover was hard on someone who was about to lose a loved one. For example, that time when he was 23 mins late, she should've spoken up if it bothered her. I don't know if I was empathizing with Sebastien because I was also a horrible friend when I was about to lose my grandmother. I felt like the author missed the mark on this one, I felt like the reader was supposed to resent Sebastien instead of realizing that dating while losing someone you love is not always a good idea. I would've loved a discussion on how grieving is lonely and that we cling to anyone or anything just to feel less lonely.
* Hugo was too insta-love. Unfortunately, Ms. Perfect doesn't exist and I thought that his character was odd in the book. The book is sad, heart-breaking and full of regrets and there, she finds the perfect man who matches all her criteria and remembers everything about her. Clover needed to find someone who wasn't exactly perfect but with whom she would've felt good. I felt like Hugo was just her grandfather in a younger form. 

This was longer than I expected but I needed to get it off my chest. Overall it was a great book (3.5 stars), and a beautiful debut, I just had some ick through my reading",hater_first,1ge6taa,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ge6taa/the_collected_regrets_of_clover_by_mikki_brammer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ge6taa/the_collected_regrets_of_clover_by_mikki_brammer/,2024-10-28 16:45:29,10,1.0,10,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1ge6taa

books,Steppenwolf - Discussion &amp; Thoughts,"Steppenwolf might be *the* official anti-pretentious hipster manifesto, exclusively read by pretentious hipsters.  
  
In all seriousness, this is a nice story about freeing yourself from your personal preconceptions about yourself. Our main character, Harry Haller is pretentious and has locked himself into a cycle of looking down on what he deems 'lesser art' and the people who enjoy it. This leads him to perceive himself as the 'steppenwolf', an isolated lonesome wolf figure which lives apart from society. Throughout the book he meets characters that will question his stance and his binary view of the world which leads to quite interesting discussions.  
  
I thought the book was quite well written, despite somewhat of a slow start. It's easy to see yourself in some capacity in Harry Haller's character. When he's in a new setting and is deeply uncomfortable by the actions of people, or when he sneers at others to protect himself. It's ultimately sort of a coming of age story, except we're following a man going through suicidal ideation and depressive thoughts in his 40s. This means we get to read through the classic tropes such as Harry finding love, going out dancing, taking drugs (wait, what?) and emerging from his shell.  
  
The supernatural elements of the novel which live in Harry's mind drive the mysterious elements forward and really provide a unique energy to the story. The entire sequence of the Fancy Dress Ball really struck me and by that point I was in a frenzy as well, reading as fast as Harry was drunkenly dancing with whoever crossed his path. These were by far my favorite scenes, especially those with Hermine as Hermann.  
  
Harry thinks there is a wolf inside of him. He thinks that personality is binary. Either he's the wolf, a reminder of all things natural and ready to bite anything that crosses him, or he's the human would-be bourgeois who strives to live through high-art. He doesn't realise that there is an infinite amount of personalities and beings that live within him, and that his commitment to seeing the world through the lens of duality is deeply hurting him and setting him back. The trial he finds himself in by the end tests and challenges this dilemma he's dug himself into.",bernabeth,1ge3kho,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ge3kho/steppenwolf_discussion_thoughts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ge3kho/steppenwolf_discussion_thoughts/,2024-10-28 14:34:46,25,0.83,25,0,10,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ge3kho

books,my confusion with unreliable narrators,"I recently read Babel and i was reading reviews about the book. I saw many comments about how robin is an unreliable narrator, actually his friends group wasn't as close as he thinks and he just wanted to have a family that's why he thought like this. BUT this sounded like an interpretation to me rather than him being necessarily unreliable.

Later i found out rf kuang also stated Robin is unreliable one of her [interview](https://www.goodreads.com/interviews/show/1570.R_F_Kuang)s;  
*RFK: The narrator of the main text is Robin, whose point of view is extremely narrow and limited. He only knows what he knows, and he doesn't know very much, so he's confused most of the time. He's a classically unreliable narrator, and if you take the text through his eyes, then you come off with a very small idea of what's going on throughout the story. ""*

ISN'T THIS how pretty much all first-person narrators are?? :'D i think you can say this for almost every first-person narrator because they are human with subjective opinions. this ""unreliable narrator"" just creates an open interpretation for the readers' which is normal like this is how literature works but nowadays i feel like readers are nit-picking and taking it too far. cmon if you interpret deeply enough, any character could be seen as unreliable... 

I think one of the best example of an unreliable narrator was The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes. the whole point of the book is how our memories aren’t always accurate; people tend to reshape them without even realizing, making the past seem the way they want to remember. And you discover this with the main character as you read the book, also he realises the way he perceived events are distorted when he finds old letters from his past. Personally I think this is a narrator you can safely call ""unreliable"". 

IDK am i missing something? personally i need some concrete evidence to call a character unreliable; otherwise, it feels like just a speculation hahaha

books,"Tempted to reread ""The Last Election"" by Andrew Yang and Stephen Marche","I read the book in September 2023. I found it relatively interesting and compelling though realize many aspects of it were very traumatized.

None of us I've enjoyed it. However I am reading it again as we get close to the election. I'm very sure I will finish it anytime. I'm just wondering if it's hitting too close to home.

books,My thoughts on George Orwell’s 1984: what’s even the point?,"So not too long ago (I think in my second semester of college), I had to read 1984 (by George Orwell). I’m usually used to horror books (especially by R.L. Stine and Stephen King), and wasn’t too big of a fan to dystopian genre, so I thought this may do the trick; it didn’t, at all.

Now let me be clear, I do acknowledge that the book have been very influential, and it does provide some perspective in politics, but only some.

I read books mainly from the point of view of storytelling, and to be quite frank, I’m not a fan of 1984. So what are my problems with this book?

1. Needless repetitions: essentially in part 2, all the book does is repeat the same shit in Goldstein’s book over and over and over and over again. We get it, we don’t need 30-40 pages worth of monologue that could easily be shaved down.

2. Lack of subtleties: what I like about any stories is subtlety. Unfortunately, 1984 did not have any of that at all. All it does it beat you in the head with a baseball bat telling you that totalitarianism is bad over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. I don’t need to be told several times in several ways how Stalinist/N@zi totalitarianism is bad. I get it. I’ve read the Cold War before, you don’t need to repeat to keep saying it louder and hold my hand throughout the book. The concepts in the book are also too simplistic to be meaningful or deep.

3. Amorphous application: people on both sides of American politics like to say that 1984 is prophetic, but I would argue it is no more prophetic than simply saying “all politicians are liar.” No shit Sherlock. It’s not prophetic, and it’s arguably more amorphous to any political enemies, whether it be Trump or Kamala or whoever a person doesn’t like.

Nitpick 1: basically, this isn’t really a real criticism, but more so my personal nitpick on the story, but Winston is a major creep and I’d hate to know what fetishes does Julia have to even “share the bed” with that creep. Bro just admits wanting to r-pe and slit her throat…and she had sex with him anyway??? Nobody will realistically do that if a guy/gal admits something like that in front of their face. Yes I’m aware the society in 1984 is very war-hungry and totalitarian, I get it. But can’t we at least have one decent character that doesn’t at least have a major problem???

Nitpick 2: another nitpick of mine is the seemingly invincibility of The Party, which I find unrealistic. Even totalitarian parties like national socialists and Soviet Russia eventually collapsed. Why can’t the Party collapse as well? The appendix didn’t really give me that much hope either.

Overall, not a big fan of 1984 at all. I don’t consider it a classic. Influential? Sure, but no more influential than memes.",SorrowfulSpirit02,1gdug23,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gdug23/my_thoughts_on_george_orwells_1984_whats_even_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gdug23/my_thoughts_on_george_orwells_1984_whats_even_the/,2024-10-28 05:03:53,0,0.18,0,0,96,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gdug23
books,When have you ever come to a totally wrong (or atleast uncommon) interpretation of a story?,"I recently started Songs of A Dead Dreamer, a collection of stories by Thomas Ligotti. I read another collection of his stuff (Teatro Grottesco) last year and dug it even if it came off as a bit too high brow at times.

This guy is an alien.

That weird sculpture thing he had in his apartment? An alien device.

That mysterious club that he's a part of? Also aliens in human disguses.

That crazy shit with the sky he showed gf during their vacation? Alien stuff. His spaceship, maybe.

About 3/4 through the book I was in the car listening to NPR, when they announced Gary Paulsen had died that day. I cried the entire drive home. To have him die while reading his memoir was extremely intense; like losing a friend. 

It’s 2024 and I still think of him and “Miss” him.

books,Frisk by Dennis Cooper (Book Review),"I don't think I'm in a proper state to review this book, but then again, if I don't review it now; perhaps I won't ever in the future.

This was disturbing. Please, I'm putting stress on the word ""disturbing"". Petrifying and nightmarish. To compare; I've read "" The Sluts"" by the same author and it was just uhh, nerve wracking  and painfully dusturbing dump(?), I mean, it was structured in the layout of a website so much of the nuance and critical dwellings were shut off, I feel like, in my opinion. But this? Holy hell. In Frisk, we are following a first person narrative. This sole structuring already opens up alot of gates for intricate and critical depths of dwellings and progressing. I really liked it but oh my, everytime I read a Cooper, it takes me weeks to recover. True halloween and spooky season read if you may.

So anyways; Frisk is a story about intense and extreme sexual desires and fantasies. Here, we follow our narrator from his early years as a teen to his mid 30s. A pornographic incident from when he was 13 strirred up his sexual sadistic desires and made him addictively erotic to such exposures. The brink of reality and illusion starts to fade as with each passing moments the extreme sadistic desires within our narrator keeps prominently getting stronger and stronger to a point where he daydreams all the time of killing others in utterly brutal ways and takes sexual self pleasure within such thoughts. I can't make you understand the intensity of his sexual urges and thoughts; I can't. You have to read to understand it properly; all I can say is; the book felt so real and eerie with such portrayals of fantasies and erotic desires within our narrator that it will always keep you on the toes and you thinking that ""fuck, now he is actually going to do some of those vile things"" ; but no.

**Some spoilers here** 

He doesn’t, the chapter before the last chapter. The chapters which actually fucked me over and made me shiver, no joke, also while simultaneously making me genuinely gag to the point I felt like I was about to puke (multiple times). This chapter was devastating and bloody fucking messed up. So unsettling and petrifying, I'm inable to comprehend the intensity. Our narrator wrote a lengthy letter to his past lover describing everything in detail about what had happened since the last 2 years. Well, there were descriptions of his extreme sadistic sexual urges coming to life and he killing others, but in such a brutal and detailed mannered that felt so real. But plot twist, it wasn’t! All this was fakery.

This goes to show in what level his sexual urges dug within himself that he can craft such intense and utterly repulsive descriptions of his fantasies. To think of this is itself disturbing; the entirety of the novel displays sexual paraphilic disorder in such a distinct and striking lens that feels extremely sinking. I'm actually in awe with how masterfully the author crafted this utter vile atmosphere that radiates extreme eerieness and quite frankly, severely menacing and disturbing tone. The nonchalance of our narrator in describing every unusual and horrific details just added more complexity and horror to the story. 

We can observe how the psychological descend and the growing intensity of his sexual sadistic desires hindered his life and his everyday living over the years and almost threw him in the brink of insanity. He didn’t kill anyone; yet. And the fact that he didn’t, shows even a bit of rationality and control he has over himself and his devouring urges that eats at him, which felt extremely real to the point of uncanniness. The dire and morbid consequences of obsession and such desires were greatly portrayed in the novel. 

Realistic, nuanced and shivering. Frisk is a story that blends the reality and fictional portrayals of inhumane desires quite effortlessly which leaves us, the readers, in a void of monstrous fearful cycle. Even concluding this review, I feel like I haven’t said anything or have stated excessively. I seem to never be able to review Dennis Cooper's novels smoothly and/or properly. Genuinely liked the story for what it was but I'm glad I finished it and I'm free.",manthan_zzzz,1gdkvw8,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gdkvw8/frisk_by_dennis_cooper_book_review/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gdkvw8/frisk_by_dennis_cooper_book_review/,2024-10-27 20:48:48,7,0.77,7,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gdkvw8
books,What books do you think young people should read and why?,"There are many lists of classic or recommended literature.

Feel free to suggest books that never show up on such list or ones that do, just as long as it is something that has an impact on you, and tell us what you think a young reader would learn from it.

Here are mine:
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  Even though it's short, I think I would recommend it at the college level to avoid shallow take-aways.  I think it's valuable because it shows the importance of empathy.  I would want to have a discussion about the mood organ, whether that's valuable, and if there's anything like it in real life.

Speaker for the Dead
I think this is valuable because it demonstrates that our assumed reasons for other people's behavior often does not match the real reasons.  People are complex, and in order to know why they do the things they do, we have to be willing to see things from their point of view.

books,Bland Characters and Finale in 'Salem's Lot,"First off, despite the overall negative tone of this post, I just want to say that I did overall enjoy 'salem's Lot by Stephen King. It's also possible that I came in with expectations that were unattainable. I mean, Stephen King and vampires? That has to be amazing. Right? Almost every review I saw said so, at least.

What I liked: The attention put into the townspeople. I loved the theme of the ""little"" everyday evils perpetrated by normal people. The detached sheriff. The drunk priest. And of course, Ms. McDougall and her penchant for infant abuse. Cringe inducing, it was great. I also liked the theory about the haunted house being some sort of idol that attracted evil to it and possibly even seeped evil into the surrounding community like a radioactive spill. 

Disappointments: So in a book with the background characters being a little more fleshed out, you'd think that the main protagonists would be super compelling. In my opinion, they weren't. Ben doesn't really have any noticeable personality traits besides being a writer and being able to act manly when trying to impress his girlfriend's father. He has his backstory of his experience at the Marsten house (which I did like and appreciate as his reason for coming back) and his experience becoming a widow. Now, I'm not great at recognizing themes or metaphors, so maybe I'm missing something, but I don't understand why the dead wife detail is here. Obviously watching your SO die would be very traumatic, and it is brought up multiple times in the book, but it doesn't seem to impact anything? Ben seems more concerned with his childhood nightmares that with his dead wife. The girlfriend was equally uninspiring and is just sort of there. 

The main band that forms to oppose the vampires supposedly has a deep bond, but as the reader, I find it hard to buy in. The girlfriend (I literally finished the book today and I can't remember the name. I remember Eva Miller, Ben's fat landlord, but not her) tells Ben she loves him on like their 2nd or 3rd date, Ben and Matt get tight very quickly, Ben and Mark form a tight mentor-mentee bond - but the leg work just isn't there and it's very obvious that these characters are being forced together by the author. And I'm not even sure what the solution is. Yes, King could've written more character-building scenes to flesh out the characters and their relationships, but the book is already pretty long. I personally would be fine with another 100-200 pages if it made the characters better, but I saw some people complaining about the book length as it is. I read Lonesome Dove last year and I feel like it's ruined a lot of books for me since. I want real characters, complex relationships. It's hard to find books that can scratch that itch exactly right. 

It's basically a meme at this point that SK isn't very good at endings and I think that happened here too. I think burning the town at the end was a good callback to the town's history, but the finale was very underwhelming. Firstly, Barlow's hiding place is supposed to be a mystery. And I think most people like to try to solve that mystery along with the protagonist. But, correct me if I'm wrong, Barlow's hiding place has zero foreshadowing. The big clue is that he has blue chalk on his fingers. We're led around on a few theories before one character remembers that Eva Miller has a pool table in her cellar from a conversation that is had outside the book's scope. There's no way for the reader to play along and it just comes out of nowhere. I didn't care too much about this but it just seemed odd. Then when they find his resting place, Barlow's big defense is a Home Alone-style trap. It kills one member, granted, but I'm not sure how he thought this would work on all four members of the vampire hunters. It's a trap that, once sprung, will get no one else. You could argue that he also sent an assassin, but that was a middle-aged woman wearing a night dress. Not exactly subtle or effective. Barlow is built up to be this mastermind who is nearly unbeatable, but he goes over like a wet fart. I'm perplexed at how he survived for centuries and Matt's assertion that he is some sort of chess grandmaster genius is laughable.

I apologize for the long rant. I had very high expectations for the book and that inevitably led to some disappointment. Like I said, I did overall enjoy the book. I think I just am learning that my preferences are changing and becoming more stringent. It's really a shame because I wanted to love the book. I'm curious to hear if I missed something or if anyone agrees. Did anyone fall in love with these characters?

books,Do you purchase kindle books even if they are more expensive than paperbacks?,"I got myself Kindle a few months ago and I love it. Most of the books I've purchased so far were *""I am not sure if I'm going to like it so I'm not buying a physical copy yet""* or *""yay - sale!""*, but recently, I've wanted to reduce the amount of books I have at home and purchase more ebooks.

However, it often happens that physical books are cheaper than the ebooks, so in those circumstances, I feel like I cannot justify buying them. For example, there's a series I want to purchase right now, and paperbacks are £20.50 for six books. If I purchase the series as ebooks, it comes to £31.50, roughly 50% more! 

So I guess my question is whether you compare prices before deciding on which format you buy? Or do you have a preferred format and buy it regardless the price?

books,Visiting Main Street with Sinclair Lewis,"I had always only had a vague awareness of Lewis as the author of It Can't Happen Here. It was only when I learned about his winning the Nobel Prize that I looked at his work and decided that Main Street sounded the most attuned to my interests.

Carol Milford is a left-wing feminist from the city, whose directionless life takes a new turn when she marries Doctor Will Kennicott. He takes her to live in Gopher Prairie, a town that represents not just Sauk Centre where Lewis grew up, but all the small towns in America, perhaps the world. She runs up against the low cultural expectations, the resolutely right-wing politics, and intense culture of gossip and scrutiny, in various episodes of about eight years of life. Unlike the cliche tales of backwoods life, this book will not end with the girl admitting the silliness of her big-city education and becoming happy with the moral perfection of what she finds.

Early on, it becomes painful the degree to which the country's basic cultural and political conflicts haven't changed. Much has been made of the fact that the two parties were much less ideologically sorted back then, but it still holds true that to a great degree, the Republicans were the party of those with property, both the billionaires and the small-town car salesmen. Lewis' view of the stifling boredom of the small town reads as almost identical to the critiques of suburbia that would written decades later, the articles trying to understand MAGA towns being written today.

Lewis scorns the close-mindedness and narrow visions that the small towns impose; that's for certain. But I was surprised to see that he was not as cynical as I had expected him to be. Carol, too, is a woman full of foibles and elitism of her own, and the book's most decent character turns out to be the unassuming, boring Kennicott. He is acerbic about the flaws in Gopher Prairie, yet he still takes time to acknowledge that there is happiness and comfort and the possibility for improvement in the lives these people choose to live.

&gt; They were staggered to learn that a real tangible person, living in Minnesota, and married to their own flesh-and-blood relation, could apparently believe that divorce may not always be immoral; that illegitimate children do not bear any special and guaranteed form of curse; that there are ethical authorities outside of the Hebrew Bible; that men have drunk wine yet not died in the gutter; that the capitalistic system of distribution and the Baptist wedding-ceremony were not known in the Garden of Eden; that mushrooms are as edible as corn-beef hash; that the word “dude” is no longer frequently used; that there are Ministers of the Gospel who accept evolution; that some persons of apparent intelligence and business ability do not always vote the Republican ticket straight; that it is not a universal custom to wear scratchy flannels next the skin in winter; that a violin is not inherently more immoral than a chapel organ; that some poets do not have long hair; and that Jews are not always peddlers or pantsmakers.

Analyzing the political character of rural America is definitely a great part of the novel. The townsfolk are aware of the fact that they are engaged in class struggle against the farmers who they serve as merchants for. These were, indeed, the sorts of folk that were slaughtering their black neighbors in droves in this period. Yet there's some things I curiously didn't find out - people did not seem overly angry or anxious that the hated Democrats controlled the federal government. With Prohibition, it was actually hard to tell whether people overall supported it or not.

This is self-consciously a very feminist novel. Carol is passionately drawn, human, driven, always aware in little ways of the ways in which being a housewife shapes her place in town. It feels strikingly modern, speaking as someone who never read Hardy or Ibsen. The book even touches on the still-omnipresent matter of the gendering of hobbies. The women have their liberal arts and social talk, the men have their shiny toys, their cars and guns and practical things.

&gt; In all his games, cars and guns and land, he expected Carol to take an interest. But he did not give her the facts which might have created interest. He talked only of the obvious and tedious aspects; never of his aspirations in finance, nor of the mechanical principles of motors. This month of romance she was eager to understand his hobbies. She shivered in the garage while he spent half an hour in deciding whether to put alcohol or patent non-freezing liquid into the radiator, or to drain out the water entirely. “Or no, then I wouldn’t want to take her out if it turned warm—still, of course, I could fill the radiator again—wouldn’t take so awful long—just take a few pails of water—still, if it turned cold on me again before I drained it—Course there’s some people that put in kerosene, but they say it rots the hose-connections and—Where did I put that lug-wrench?”

The book does sound like what I've heard about Chekhov's writing in its frustration with the boring idiocy of rural life. I'll have to check in on Three Sisters at some point.

In this book I also found an enjoyment of marriage stories that I’ve never properly cultivated. The fights are sad to read, yet the underlying emotional bond manages to survive. I hope Revolutionary Road is as good as people say it is.

All in all, I had a deliciously solid meal after spending a long time without long novels. I found a passionately humane, empathetic voice in Lewis' writing, and it makes me eager to find another one of his books.",PM_BRAIN_WORMS,1gch4yz,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gch4yz/visiting_main_street_with_sinclair_lewis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gch4yz/visiting_main_street_with_sinclair_lewis/,2024-10-26 09:19:55,15,0.95,15,0,6,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gch4yz

books,John LeCarre Appreciation Thread,"A few years ago, I found myself snowed in with no internet connection. Earlier, a friend had gifted me a complete collection of John LeCarre audiobooks. So I spent about a week doing jigsaw puzzles and listening to spy novels. Not a bad way to spend a few days.

I was struck by the skill LeCarre has as a writer. LeCarre, we all know, worked for both MI5 and MI6 for a while in his youth. In his autobiography, he says that the best training as a writer he ever got was from writing reports to his superiors. His superiors, being all highly-educated Oxford men, were ruthless in grading the language of his reports. They would red-pencil his reports mercilessly, telling him to avoid extraneous words and details and to state his summaries clearly, concisely, and in as few words as possible.

LeCarre, I think is especially gifted when writing his descriptions and grew more skilled from his job in the spy business. Being something of a writer myself, I grew more and more impressed with his skill during that snowed-in week, and I eventually got in the habit of stopping the recording and copying down some of my favorite sentences of his just because they were such a pleasure to marvel at. I recently found that old notebook and found those LeCarre quotes. That prompted this post. Here are a few examples:

One of his characters ventures out in a small boat near an aircraft carrier. LeCarre writes that the carrier

&gt;lay gray and menacing like an unsheathed knife above the water.

Describing a young clerk

&gt;He was a tall, mathematical-looking boy with spectacles and an unblinking gaze.

Describing a luxury box at a racetrack populated by millionaires and gangsters

&gt;A group of wives sat apart like expensive, unused, equipment.

Describing the spinster daughter of an elderly clergyman

&gt;Since girlhood, nothing seemed to have happened to her face beyond a steady diminishing of its hopes.

One of his spies describes her smarmy boss, saying,

&gt;Don doesn't do confrontation. His life is a sideways advance between things he can't face.

I have a few more, but that's a good sample. I don't know about you guys, but I'm impressed at how well LeCarre can capture the essence of something in very few words. He describes one man as having a ""puffy, agricultural face."" You can just *see* that man in those few words.

The fact that you get an interesting spy story is a bonus when you have a talented writer. LeCarre is the kind of writer who could make a trip to the grocery store interesting to read, so a spy thriller is icing on the cake.

One criticism of LeCarre I have is that, when taken in bulk over a snowed-in week doing jigsaw puzzles, his stories too often have a melancholy end. There's rarely a true victory. Our heroes may get the bad guy in the end, but it costs them dearly. And, many times, the bad guy gets away. One never comes away from his books feeling energized and full of hope. But maybe that's the real secret of the secret world. The spy game is not a happy one. However, with a skilled writer, it's always a pleasure to read.

Spoiler&gt;!When Karla finally gives up and George Smiley gets the victory over his life-long opponent, Karla drops the famous cigarette lighter in the snow. A symbolic moment. Smiley doesn't even bother to pick it up. That's LeCarre in a nutshell.!&lt;",PaulsRedditUsername,1gc36lc,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gc36lc/john_lecarre_appreciation_thread/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gc36lc/john_lecarre_appreciation_thread/,2024-10-25 19:56:35,166,0.96,166,0,60,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gc36lc
books,What character(s) you got invested in that you thought you wouldn't care too much about?,"I have read many novels and I have liked many female characters, like Navani and Vin from the Cosmere and Yerin from Cradle, but I never got *invested* in them as much as male characters.

books,Somewhere beyond the sea by TJ Klune,"**UPDATE: My first DNF ever. 1/79 :(** 

Let me start by saying, I LOVED 'The house in the cerulean sea'. I started the sequel today 'Somewhere beyond the sea', I'm 100 pages in and strongly considering DNF.

It feels so political. Worst, it feels like a straight up sermon, like I'm being preached at. There are some great quotes but they feel misplaced? I don't even know how to explain it, it's like there isn't enough story. Just buzz words, therapy type talk. and quotes. I'm so disappointed.

I am wondering, does it get better? Should I just quit? I was so excited to read this book but now I'm sitting here like ""ugghhhh here we go"" and procrastinating reading more of it.

books,Size of books,"Tl;dr: Does anyone know why publishers change the size of their books half way through a series? And do they usually release books in more sizes later? If so, do you wait for the ”correct” size or do you just accept that the bookshelf looks uneven?

I recently bought the last two books in TJ Klunes Green Creek series. I always buy paperback and that unfortunately means big size differences sometimes. The first two books in the series are small and the last two are bigger. Same publisher, same cover art, same everything except for the size. This bugs me more than it should. 

Now that I’m wanting to read the sequel to The House in the Cerulean Sea, Somewhere Beyond the Sea, I asked the book shop first about size and surprise surprise, it’s also way bigger than the first book. So now Im wondering if I should buy it or if I should maybe borrow it from the library for now and wait to buy it in case it comes out in the smaller size. 

I also bought another one of his books, same publisher, published between books 3 and 4 of the Greek Creek series, and that one was the small size. So it’s not like all the newer books are big. 

I know this is a nonissue, but it bugs me and I think some people here might understand the struggle haha. This happens so often that I’m beginning to suspect they do it on purpose because they hate us /jk

books,"I read Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"", and it was hauntingly beautiful and powerful.","As much as I enjoy reading good novels, they practically never get a true visceral reaction out of me. The closest I got to that was A Farewell to Arms. However, after reading one of Cormac McCarthy's other novels, Blood Meridian (which is amongst my favorites) I really wanted to read the Road. I had watched the movie a while before and I remembered liking it, so I decided to buy the book, and I'm glad I did!

This story was so interesting to me I read the entire book (almost 300 pages) in less than 2 days. The best word I can describe this book as, is ""haunting"". It's a tragic story of a father doing his absolute best to take care of his son in a post-apocalyptic world full of starvation, violence, cannibalism. Everyone is on the fight for survival. All are trying to take care of themselves or their families. And the main character, simply known as ""the man"", is no exception. He steals and loots for the sake of his son's safety and welfare.

The two main characters are exceptionally realistic, to the point where it hurts to read. They speak to each other incredibly naturally, like a father would with his young boy to try to make him happy and take care of him. I could easily see my father in the same position as the Man and myself as the Boy, making the same decisions, saying the same things, and thinking the same thoughts. Through their hardships and adventures, they are some of the most deeply personal characters I've seen in a story. It makes sense that this book was inspired by McCarthy's own conversations with his son, since it has such a simple and beautiful genuineness to it, as if these were conversations that were already spoken.

Unlike a lot of McCarthy's other works, it doesn't depict heavy amounts of extreme depravity or sadistic violence, but it mostly consists of the Man and the Boy repeating the cycle of survival. Scavenging for food, searching through abandoned homes and shelters, gathering resources, engaging in conversation with each other, and following the road to the coast. The story is mostly a repeated cycle of this, with some occasional, more intense sequences of suspense sprinkled in carefully. The rare amount of suspense and heavy use of conversations between the Man and the Boy builds up the characters to make them more relatable and understandable, which I think it succeeds exceptionally in doing. By the second half, all I wanted was just for the father and his son to escape, alive and well.

As for the ending (which I will not spoil), I've never cried to a book until I read The Road. The ending was achingly sad, but I wouldn't say it was bleak or hopeless, unlike Blood Meridian's ending. As tragic as it is, there was an element of hope, joy, and positivity. At the last few pages of the novel, the father talks to his son about ""carrying the fire"" to other people. I am not sure exactly what this means, but I interpreted the act of ""carrying the fire"" as spreading humanity's indomitable will to survive to other people, so they may get through the hardest of times (like the trials the father and son go through together). Kind of like the movie ""Grave of the Fireflies"", I thought it was tragic and heart-wrenching, but not with beauty and hope.

I recommend everyone to give this book a try. It's not for everyone by any means; it may be too repetitive for some, or too depressing for others, but it's a powerful experience that you should experience at least once. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this novel!",PraiseBToGod_12345,1gbirhj,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gbirhj/i_read_cormac_mccarthys_the_road_and_it_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gbirhj/i_read_cormac_mccarthys_the_road_and_it_was/,2024-10-25 01:24:24,343,0.89,343,0,113,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gbirhj

I went through some traumatic experience involving sexual assault so It is quite triggering for me). In the past, when I was struggling with depression, I read The Midnight Library, which actually worsened my mental state because of the depressing main character and complete misunderstanding of the depression described in the book, It seemed like the book was saying, life could be worse, or whatever choice you make, you would still be miserable so just don't be depressed.

books,I just finished Dust by Hugh Howey and I am underwhelmed by the ending of this otherwise interesting trilogy.,"Anyone else feel underwhelmed by the ending of the Silo series? 

Wool was so interesting. Full of suspense and intrigue. Dark and even scary at parts.

Shift was probably my favourite of the three books. Donald’s story was an amazing addition and learning how the world of Silos came to be was fascinating.

As for Dust, I enjoyed the first half, but felt it lacked an impactful and engaging climax. It just really lost steam. I expected Jules to take more exciting action than simply hosting a town hall. I guess Donald blowing up Silo 1 was the big action moment, but it felt like that belonged to Jules as the true protagonist. 

I really struggled to get through the ending. Felt like it lost all momentum when they moved to Silo 17.

books,"Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"".","Got to finish one of Heinlein's early novels for today, this being 1951's ""The Puppet Masters"".

In the summer of 2007, unknown to the inhabitants of the Earth, flying saucers carrying slug like creatures have landed and are now attacking the planet and its people. To take over the world the aliens attach themselves on a human host, on their backs, and take control of the nervous system, and use them as a puppet.

Because of this the whole planet is thrown into a quiet chaos. However there a few agents who could be able to save it. Three members of a secret national security agency are on the case investigating a flying saucer sighting in Iowa, and also the disappearance of six operatives.

When they find the city to be completely overrun with the creatures, they try to convince the President about it but fail. Can they manage to stop it in time?

Heinlein's earlier novels, or novel in this case, are much more tighter than his more well known later novels and is just full of action.I can't really help but raise an eyebrow at the really absurd method that they use to identify those who have not been taken over by the slugs. It reads like a script for one of those science fiction films that were popping up in the fifties, though I don't think film studios at the time weren't as likely as keen too adapt this into a script!

But this book also conjures up an intense sense of paranoia. After all it was published during the time of McCarthyism. Oh, and it also drew inspiration from the ""flying saucer' craze that was also happening too. But aside from all that, this is another example of some really fun, and cheesy, science fiction from the 50s!",i-the-muso-1968,1gbfv0u,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gbfv0u/heinleins_the_puppet_masters/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gbfv0u/heinleins_the_puppet_masters/,2024-10-24 22:58:41,51,0.94,51,0,51,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1gbfv0u
books,Do the hunger games books low key describe the Israeli occupation of Palestine?,"Israel is like the capitol. They have occupied the 13 districts which is Palestine.

books,The Brilliant Disaster by Jim Rasenberger (2011),"The Brilliant Disaster by Jim Rasenberger (2011) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
  
I have a lot of thoughts about the contents of this book, and I hope I will be forgiven if I ramble and meander a bit in this review.  
  
Man, what even was the 1960's? What a decade of madness and paranoia. Reading Jim Rasenberger's retelling of the Bay of Pigs event was both thrilling and intriguing. This narrative even moreso shaped how I view the communications, scheming, ideologies and clashes of agendas that exist within our government, especially around regime changes. Combine this with the aura of suspicion and secrecy that the Cold War shrouded the world in, and it makes for some incredible events. Here, Rasenberger centers his concentration around the catastrophe which was the Bay of Pigs.  
  
The main characters in this story consists of some of the heaviest hitters in 20th century history. We have the charmed John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert, and his wife Jaqueline. We have Eisenhower and Nixon. Across the pond we get Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, two boogeymen to 20th century U.S. Presidents. And the terrifying Nikita Khrushchev, head of a Soviet Union locked in a bitter nuclear staring contest with the United States. A clash of ideologies make for Soviet Invasions in Hungary, Czechoslavakia, and later Afghanistan. The contagion of Communism sparks proxy wars in the Koreas, Laos, Vietnam, to name a few. Not to mention a tug of war over Berlin in Germany, and a fevered race to space. The decision-making that goes into these events are blistered with tension, confusion, projection and covert wackiness that makes for an intensely entertaining time period.  
  
Then there is Cuba. To summarize Rathenberger's version of events: a militaristic Fidel Castro overthrows a corrupt Prime Minister in Cuba by the name of Fulgencio Batista, in the late 1950's. While corrupt, Batista had good relationship with then U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a fact that causes the U.S. government to sour on Castro from the beginning. The young Castro tries to make a good first impression with the U.S, even traveling to NY to meet government leaders and tour the city. Eisenhower snubs meeting Castro to play golf, and instead send his VP Richard Nixon to entertain the revolutionary. Castro suspects his unpopularity with the U.S. government, though New Yorkers flock to him everywhere he goes. He finally gets fed up with Nixon and other government members when they repeatedly press him about his opinion on Communism. Fidel leaves America with a bad taste about its leaders.   
  
Fast forward to early 1960 where Castro begins relations with the Soviet Union. Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev suspects that Cuba and America are in troubled diplomatic waters, and decides to taunt the U.S. by showing friendliness towards Castro and his lieutenants, including the popular Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. This newfound relationship irks Eisenhower, and he begins plans on how to remove Castro from power covertly. Plans that at points even include the Mafia. Eisenhower in conduct with the C.I.A, formulate a plan to raise an organic Cuban expeditionary force made up of anti-Castro rebels, train them in Central America with American special ops, equip them with American weapons and aircraft, and help them launch an Invasion on Cuba. The problem here is that in 1960, Eisenhower was in his last year in office, and his Vice President Nixon was locked in a tight race with a young, popular, upstart Democratic Nominee in John F. Kennedy. For a smooth transition of this plan to work, Nixon would need to win the Presidency in 1961. He does not.  
  
The crux of the problems of the Bay of Pigs Invasion occur at the start when Kennedy inherits this operation from Eisenhower, an operation scheduled to go down in April merely 3 months into Kennedy's Presidency. As CIA directors, and Pentagon officials scramble to catch Kennedy up to speed, I don't believe Kennedy himself, or his cabinet members, really ever understand the parameters of the operation. The CIA under Eisenhower had planned a daytime operation meant to land the Cuban rebels on the beaches with a show of force consisting of disguised American airpower, surprising and shocking Castro's forces, and stirring up the Cubans to rise up and rebel against Castro's administration. Kennedy never really seems to grasp the intent of this operation, and begins changing the plans to fit his view. He wants a covert nighttime infiltration, with limited airpower, to secretly grow the uprising from within. From the start he, and the CIA he inherited become locked in a power struggle over how the operation is to unfold. And there isn't really enough time to iron it all out.  
  
Questions arise out of reading this book that I find baffling, and why this era is so interesting. Why was the CIA and Eisenhower so sure that the Cubans would rise up against Castro, a notion Castro had nipped in the bud anyway by jailing possible dissenters? Why didn't Kennedy just cancel the operation altogether, a plan he never truly felt good about? Why didn't the U.S. see that every time they snubbed Castro, they pushed him closer to the Soviet Union and to Communism? A fear that would eventually manifest itself due to U.S. paranoia.   
  
The Brilliant Disaster is an intense day-by-day, play-by-play narrative that will leave you wanting to learn more about the Cold War. Jim Rasenberger is a fantastic storyteller, and presents an easy to read page turner on an amazing era of politics and ideology. Pair this with Steve Coll's Ghost Wars, and treat yourself to an intense ride on a political landscape that still mystifies us even today.

books,I can't get enough of the unhinged female protagonist,"I don’t know about you, but I love books with an unlikeable female protagonist. This trope has been around for a while now, but its shape and meaning has transformed under the guise of an ever-changing society. Throughout history, the chaotic female character has been used to fight back against the ideals and norms of society when it comes to what’s expected of us as women. You might be familiar with Charlotte in The Yellow Wallpaper or Mr. Rochester’s first wife Bertha in Jane Eyre. 

The unhinged female protagonist doesn’t stop there. We have an array of modern day equivalents. Take the show Fleabag, for example. The character is angry, brushing off anyone who tries to help her through as she battles with grief. She has no filter and uses humor as a defense mechanism. There’s the book Nightbitch, about a woman dealing with the struggles of her new life as an isolated mother. She misses her life as an artist, before she had a child. Throughout the story, we follow her as she evolves into an angry, feral dog-like being. The book is depicted by many as a metaphor for postnatal depression. Finally, Irina from Boy Parts is a self-destructive, unlikeable narcissist who commits some awful acts. I didn’t like Irina at all, in fact I found her to be an appalling person, and yet I still found her a wholly fascinating character. 

For some reason, these characters draw us in. From the murders they commit to the awful words they say, there’s just something about the way they are that makes them so thrilling to read about.

Perhaps it’s the fact that they challenge what’s expected of them. As women, we’re often told to tone it down, smile more, be less of this and more of that. Why can’t we just… be? And that’s exactly what these characters accomplish. They resonate with us because they are empowered. Yes, their actions may be more on the extreme end of the spectrum, with their murders and what not. But, you have to admit, having a female protagonist who isn’t afraid to go after what she wants makes for a riveting read.

Do you enjoy the unhinged female character trope? If so, what is it that draws you in?

books,Catch 22: I think I finally figured out how Milo's syndicate works,"So Milo buys eggs for 7c a piece and sells them for 5c a piece and makes a profit. How?      


He reveals that he actually buys eggs at 1c a piece at Sicily and sells them at Malta for 4.5c a piece. He then buys them back from Malta at 7c a piece and sells them at the mess hall for 5c a piece.     

So his balance sheet looks like:       
-1c        
+4.5c          
-7c           
+5c          
-----               
+1.5c        

In other words, he makes a profit of 3.5c at Malta and loses 2c at the mess hall, thus making a net profit of 1.5c a piece.         

Why doesn't he buy from Sicily for 1c a piece and sell for 5c a piece directly for a net profit of 4c a piece???       
He wants to hide the real source of eggs: i.e. Sicily. If he does this he'll have to reveal to the military that he's buying eggs for 1c a piece from Sicily. Then everyone would buy for 1c a piece at Sicily instead of buying from him. By keeping Sicily a secret, everyone has two options now: Buy from Malta at 7c a piece or buy from Milo at 5c a piece. Obviously everyone chooses Milo.       

The sellers at Malta can sell to Milo at 7c a piece or sell to the officers directly at 5c a piece, obviously they sell to Milo.       



If this still doesn't make sense to you, think of it this way: Milo's complicated transactions are just sharing the profit. Eggs are bought from the source (farmers) at 1c a piece and sold to the officers (who eat them) at 5c a piece for a net profit of 4c. Out of this, Malta keeps a profit of 2.5c, and Milo keeps a profit of 1.5c. He could try to keep all the profit for himself, but then he would be exposing Sicily.          


It goes even deeper. We don't know if the middle man in Malta actually exists. If the middle man is Milo himself with a different name, the profit made by the middle man is also the profit made by Milo, thus his net profit is the maximum possible 4c a piece.         

He doesn't even have to pay for transporting the eggs, since the military pays for all that. They do this because they think getting the soldiers eggs at 5c a piece is worth the transport costs. Milo also uses the transport paid for by Military for his other businesses which is an added bonus.",ChellJ0hns0n,1gb3zeq,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gb3zeq/catch_22_i_think_i_finally_figured_out_how_milos/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gb3zeq/catch_22_i_think_i_finally_figured_out_how_milos/,2024-10-24 14:30:17,251,0.92,251,0,56,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1gb3zeq

books,This continued discourse around trigger warnings is strange to me.,"I don’t know if this is true for other social platforms, but on spaces like X, Instagram, and Threads, there seems to be a cyclical discourse on the use of trigger warnings in books. For whatever reason, this topic tends to get people really heated, and some people feel like the request of trigger warnings is a major affront to the author and to the very concept of literature itself. I’ve also seen people state that they refuse to read books where authors have included them, and I just…don’t understand that stance?

I’m currently a senior medical student in the U.S., and I’m interested in specializing in neuropsychiatry. I’ve gotten some good exposure to mood disorders in my training thus, so I feel like I’ve developed a decent understanding on the nature of PTSD and how difficult it can be for some patients to manage (and there’s always more for me to learn, of course. Our faculty members don't call us lifelong-learners for nothing!). Because I currently hope to work in such an emotionally sensitive field, I’m really big on meeting people where they're at, approaching their needs with a sense of compassion, and trying to take time to understand why they have certain needs and how best those needs can be addressed.

Now, what does all that have to do with trigger warnings? Well, the primary purpose of trigger warnings is to inform readers of certain subject matter that will make an appearance in the book, so taht readers can make an informed decision about whether the story is appropriate for them to read. This is particularly important for folks with PTSD, because they can’t always predict what kind of physiological and/psychological reactions they have to certain topics, so they’d rather just stay safe and avoid topics that will lead to panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and other disproportionate reactions.

A less extreme example is myself: I can’t psychologically tolerate horror stories. Whenever I consume horror stories, I have increased difficulty with falling asleep (lasting at least a week or more). This is bad news for me, because I already struggle with insomnia at baseline and use several sleep aids. So…I just don’t read horror stories. 

Now, am I probably missing out on some great horror books? Yeah, totally. 

But I don’t consider the expectation for me to consume every great story out there more important than my need for a good night’s rest. Any doctor you know will tell you that medical school can be very energy-draining, and my body every minute of sleep it can get, so I’m more than happy to eliminate anything that interferes with my sleep/my ability to fall asleep, even at the cost of missing out on a good book. I wish this wasn’t the case, but I’m not going to suffer through sleepless nights just so I can have some kind of street cred in saying that I read horror books. I'm a big proponent of self-care, and I don't want to spend every day of my life feeling sleep-deprived, so I do what I gotta do. Sue me, I guess.

Now, for some rebuttals to common arguments against trigger warnings:

* ***“Trigger warnings spoil the story!”***

They really don’t. They're just vague warning about the broad subject matter, not a detailed description of the exact way that the topics manifest in the story and which characters they affect. They can be styled it like the viewer discretion messages at the beginning of visual media, which, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever had an issue over spoilers with.

* ***“You can’t predict everything that will trigger someone!”***

And you're absolutely right. Good thing the only expectation surrounding trigger warnings is to include obvious/major/common-sense ones (eg. rape, suicide, domestic violence) and not necessarily everything under the sun. 

Now, will there be some people with some really niche triggers? Absolutely. Will there be unreasonable people who get mad at the author for not being aware of their specific existence, and not having intimate knowledge of a stranger's niche trigger? sure. But just because *some* people will have unreasonable reactions to this topic doesn't necessarily mean that we should forego the idea all together. 

* ***“Trigger warnings dissuade people from engaging with topics that challenge them!”***

The people for whom trigger warnings are important are typically not using them because they have something against literature that challenges them. They’re usually doing it because certain topics can trigger disproportionate physiological/psychological reactions that are hard to predict and difficult to control, so they’re avoiding these topics as part of the management of their mental well-being. There’s nothing wrong or shameful about prioritizing your psychological health over a theoretical need to ‘challenge yourself’, and there are plenty of books that readers can use to ‘challenge’ their ethics/philosophies/critical thinking without needlessly forcing themselves to endure additional mental trauma. A challenge doesn't need to be traumatizing in order to be a challenge. 

* ***“I write books for adults. Adults should be able to handle any topic no problem!”***

Adults are not a monolith, and the cognition and psychology of every adult differs. Not all of them have the emotional/mental capacity to handle certain topics and still feel well afterwards, and their decision to not engage with these topics doesn’t make them any less adult. In fact, I consider it quite mature to have the self-awareness needed to recognize that you have psychological limitations regarding certain subject matter. I suspect that the world would be a much better place if more adults were willing and/or able to self-reflect on their psyche. 

Additionally, informed decision-making is a professional standard for many fields, and I view trigger warnings as being akin to that: you’re giving adult readers the info they need to make informed decisions about the stories they consume, and whatever decision they ultimately come to is their business. If you genuinely feel like they are going to suffer consequences from avoiding their triggers, then those consequences are also their business. You can't claim that trigger warnings is 'babying readers' and then simultaneously baby readers from whatever outcomes result from their decision to not engage with a certain story. I'm also yet to see any proof that avoiding serious psychological triggers leads to significant decline in literacy and other negative outcomes, but I'm open-minded, so if you've got any sources for me to check out, I am all ears. 

* ***“The only way to overcome your fears is by confronting them. Avoiding them gives them more power/makes you weak, etc.”***

This particular argument is extremely arrogant. It's really not your place to force certain types of fear-management methods onto others. Not only can every fear *not* be effectively managed with repeat exposure, but even when exposure therapy is done for things like phobias and some manifestations of PTSD, the therapy is typically done in a structured and controlled environment in the presence of qualified professionals. Why? Because said professionals understand that the triggering of certain traumas can sometimes be severe and require elevated management. Therefore, I think it’s inappropriate and a little callous to just casually tell people to ‘fix’ their PTSD with repeat exposure, as if that treatment is just a cute little magic trick that can fix anything. For casual phobias, this might not be that big of a deal, but for people with PTSD and other trauma-based disorders, it can become serious. Therefore, I think that people should be a little more mindful of just casually suggesting exposure therapy to everyone like it's no big deal.

* ***“If people avoid certain books because of trigger warnings, they’ll miss out on great books!”***

Please. I’ve seen people avoid books for far less: unappealing covers, specific tropes that they don't like, seeing the genre as being inherently inferior (eg. adult fantasy readers turning their nose up at YA fantasy, people turning their nose up at Romance/romantasy), the author being a woman/a person of color/part of the LGBTQ+ community/having a specific political alignment/etc., using certain details about the book to come to the premature conclusion that the story is 'woke trash', etc. 

Not to mention how subjective the word ‘good’ is. What are the chances that the ‘good’ books you swear that everyone needs to read are universally considered to be good? Even the classics and the ‘great authors’ of our current generation have people who think that they're a waste of time, so it’s very possible that even if a reader were to ignore the trigger warning, the book would still not have been worth reading. 

It’s also worth noting that not every assessment of a trigger warning results in a decision to not read the book. Sometimes, the trigger warnings are used as a chance for the reader to mentally prepare themselves to consume that kind of story. They’ll still read the book anyway, but when the difficult subject matter comes up, they’ll be prepared to handle it. 

* ***“I hate trigger warnings so much, and I avoid books that contain them!”***

If you complain that people who avoid books because of triggers are missing out on good books, but then you also say that you refuse to read certain books just for having the warnings, then ‘hypocritical’ is the only appropriate term to use here.

I also cannot emphasize enough how much you don’t need to read the trigger warnings if *you* personally don’t want to.  Getting angry at the trigger warning just for merely being there seems a little silly to me, and looking down on authors for being courteous enough to include them seems even sillier. Trigger warnings are there for the people who need them. If you don’t need them, great! Just flip the page and start reading the book. It doesn’t need to be this complicated. After all, you also don’t need every allergy warning that’s on a food box or every epilepsy warning in a music performance video, but you accept their presence there because you have the discernment needed to understand that some people *do* need them, and that their presence yields a net benefit with very minimal harm (if any).

TL;DR - Mental health continues to be stigmatized/not taken seriously. Trigger warnings are here to help readers make informed decisions about the content they consume. The visceral anger towards the concept of trigger warnings feels inappropriate for that their intended purpose is.

I have a feeling that the comments under this post might turn into a shit show, so forgive me in advance if I’m not able to reply to everyone. And to the user who's inevitably going to make a wisecrack about ""what if I personally get triggered by trigger warnings? 😏😏😏""......allow me to inform you in advance that this joke is not nearly as clever as you think it is.

books,My issue with the four agreements,"First off, if this book has helped you, that's genuinely wonderful. I do really like how compassionate and optimistic it is. I don't want to discount anyone's experiences, because often what people need is different. 

However, I have heard this touted as one of the ""actually good"" self help books, an alternative to the grifters and false promises. I don't think the author is a grifter, I don't know anything about him, but I don't think this book is an exception to the issues with self-help. 

My problem is that it's so individualistic. It perpetuates this idea that happiness is something you create for yourself independent of anyone else, and that what people think of you doesn't matter at all. This is quite a common idea in modern culture but it goes against our nature as social creatures. The book feels like it's against the very idea of a social contract, the concept that we all owe things to other. (also, seems kind of dubious that ancient Toltec wisdom just happens to align with modern western individualist values) 

Like take this quote from the chapter ""don't take anything personally"": ""You may even tell me, 'Miguel, what you are saying is hurting me.' But it is not what I am saying that is hurting you; it is that you have wounds that I touch by what I have said. You are hurting yourself."" But what if they are pointing out something that you legitimately need to work on? This seems antithetical to self-improvement. Especially because the author spent a whole chapter talking about how harmful our words can be to others. Sure, often people's criticism can come from their own personal issues, but we shouldn't always assume that. 

I think that the idea of self-improvement as an independent mission is inherently misguided. We can't do anything without other people. Maybe the agreements we make should be about compassion and community. 

I would genuinely really like to hear people's thoughts on this, and if they agree or disagree. (Also, if you know any self help books that are more focused on community, feel free to recommend them!)

books,The Familiar by Leigh Bardugo ,"(Contains spoilers for the ending) 

I just read The Familiar for the second time and I love the book... except for the ending. It felt way too neatly wrapped up. All the bad guys got their comeuppance and the good guys lived happily ever after. And everyone's fate correlated very neatly with the scale of their actions. I don't have a problem with happy endings, but this one just felt *too* neat. For example:

Hualit: I think it's deliberately ambiguous whether she's a ""good guy"" or not, but Luzia very explicitly (and justifiably!) resents her for living a life of luxury while refusing to help Luzia, instead leaving her to live in abject poverty and suffering abuse at the hands of her employers. And it just so happens that on the coach ride to her death, Hualit muses regretfully on her selfish unwillingness to help her niece. That just feels too on the nose to me. But that's not even the extent of it: she's then confronted with Victor's two murderous henchmen and it turns out one of them is pretty uncomfortable with killing her while the other displays no such scruples. The reluctant henchman is allowed to live, but Hualit manages to kill the bloodthirsty one. Hualit, who may be selfish but she isn't cruel, dies quickly, but the evil henchman dies slowly and miserably. But wait, there's more! An emerald Hualit had hidden in her dress finds its way into the belly of a fish and is found by a woman who promptly sells it and uses the money to escape her abusive husband. (That's a bit much, but ok.) *And* said abusive husband chokes to death on a bone from that very same fish that night. (Seriously??)

Valentina: Valentina starts off as a very abusive employer but from the very beginning of the story, Luzia feels a sort of kinship with her because she recognizes that they are both trapped and miserable by virtue of being women in a highly patriarchal society. Valentina grows kinder to Luzia as the story goes on and finally redeems herself by standing up to her husband to try to help Luzia escape and then sending her clean clothes and money for food when she is imprisoned. As a reward for her redemption, she is given a fulfilling sex life, relationship, and social life. 

Marius: Marius also abused Luzia, but unlike his wife he was too cowardly to help her when she was in danger and as punishment for that, his wife leaves him and he ends up in self-imposed exile from his own house because he can't stand her new friends. 

The villains: Victor's wife leaves him and he dies terrified and alone, and Fortun loses the majority of his magic powers. 

Luzia: I have no issue with the fact that she managed to save herself and Santangel. What I *do* take issue with is her ageless immortality that appears out of nowhere, a *deus ex machina* in the very last chapter. It was established that she could effectively make herself immortal because she can heal herself, but we'd never seen any evidence of her not aging. In fact, she seems to have aged perfectly normally until now. It's true that Teoda stopped aging so one could argue that maybe that just happens to magic users sometimes, but Teoda stopped aging when she was a child and it's awfully convenient that it happened to Luzia when she was an attractive young woman. 

This wrapped up with a bow, everyone gets their just desserts sort of ending feels appropriate for a children's fairytale and doesn't match the tone or themes of the rest of the book. It's a shame, because Bardugo is clearly a very talented writer and the characters and the rest of the story were phenomenal.

books,Blood Meridian,"I have just finished reading this book today and wow, I am breathless.  The brutality (especially against children) was harrowing to read but I feel like the gains from the book; some of the most beautiful descriptions of nature I’ve ever come across, plus the existential questions raised around the meaning of life, how we are architects of that (or not), and the nature of morality make for an absorbing and important read.  But the question I’m burning to know is what were other’s interpretations of the ending… I’m personally only a fan of ambiguous endings if they add to the reading experience, and I definitely think that is not only warranted and valid but absolutely necessary and integral in this case for proper reader engagement with the text… however I haven’t consolidated what I think.

books,"""The Prince"" by Machiavelli has me Dazed and Confused - Reflections","I have had this book on my list for some time now, but I just kind of dreaded coming to it because I felt like it might be a bit tedious. Someone close to me recommended it as a ""step by step manual on how to be a good ruler"", so I decided to finally give it a shot. 

I was pleasantly surprised that it was not tedious at all, I actually enjoyed reading it quite a lot. However, I am a bit ashamed of how long it took me to finish this book, considering its size--three months to be exact--but life got in the way, I've been very busy. 

I have six main reflection points on this book:

1. Although it was introduced to me as ""princehood for dummies"", someone else told me there is a theory that he actually wrote this book as a critique of those in power. Considering that he wrote it from exile and it wasn't published until years after his death, I guess there is a chance that this might be true? (I understand that there are many other factors contributing to its late publishing, I was just thinking out loud). Although we will never know the true intentions of the book, I think it can be interpreted either way. Wanted to hear the reddit community's thoughts on this though. 

2. I mainly enjoyed this book because I treated it as historical ""Tea"". I believe I have probably missed some of the references in this book despite the fact that the version I read had explanations and historical context included. But my historical knowledge has sort of dwindled, I studied the history of the middle ages back in my junior and senior years of highschool, but I don't remember much of it. I wish I did for the purposes of having a better understanding of the book. 

3. One of the main themes that I found intriguing and I believe has probably been beaten to death by every political sciences major in my vicinity is the theme of immorality. Machiavelli more than once justifies immoral acts and also very openly and honestly discusses all those socially taboo and unacceptable aspects of power that I have not seen discussed in this manner previously. I don't know if this is something that other political philosophers have done before him, but to my knowledge he seems to have pioneered it. I find merit in that honesty, and although it was at times very pessimistic and depressing, I think he paints quite the honest picture of power and politics. I couldn't help but think about how these principles still apply to some of the political leaders I have seen in my own country--depressing but interesting. This makes me appreciate his work more as it obviously has some value if it still applies centuries into the future. 

4. Despite much of his advice being very specific to his time--such as all the parts about the different applications of cavalry and infantry forces--I think some of his advice is pretty applicable to a variety of different scales. I don't want to act like a pseudointellectual and act like I am about to apply everything, but I even think that scaled to the corporate environment that I work in, it can apply, and I even tried something and it kind of worked.--fun little experiment, nothing serious. 

5. His last few chapters, he describes fortune as a woman and says she has to be beaten up?? wtf was that about lol. Threw me off a little bit, but sure. 

6. The biblical references were interesting to me.

books,You know a book is good when you spend the next day arguing with the characters in your head,"What books have you debating the characters (or the author) as you read? Whether it be over their society or their values or their personal choices. In my mind, the best sign a story is compelling is when you just can't stop trying to pick a fight with it. 

I just read The Terraformers by Annalee Newitz, and the whole time, I couldn't stop having imaginary debates with the characters about various aspects of the worldbuilding. This morning I woke up already in the middle of a one-sided discussion about the value of childhood as an institution and developmental stage. In the book, people reproduce in a completely different way that bypasses childhood entirely and I can't help but feel that something of value was lost even as I see that their way has its obvious advantages too.

books,I think a large number of classics are funnier than their reputation would suggest.,"There is this view of classics as being books that are written by literary gods, beyond criticism and highly intellectual. At least that was my perception. 

However, I learned later on, often from people who really enjoyed the classics, people who either had very good teachers or were self-taught, that there was more humor to be found in many famous books. 

So they made me question whether I had to take Shakespeare very seriously. Or Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Or James Joyce's writings. 

Some people say always go to the source and you will find you answers, but the problem is that books and the authors do not exist in a vacuum. Reading a book won't tell you how to read it. 

What is required, I think, is learning more about both the author and their environment.  What was life and society like where they lived? What books were popular at the time? Was the author reacting to certain literary tradition or cultural norms at the time? Who were they writing for? How were they paid?",e_2718,1ga4hun,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ga4hun/i_think_a_large_number_of_classics_are_funnier/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ga4hun/i_think_a_large_number_of_classics_are_funnier/,2024-10-23 07:11:34,571,0.96,571,0,268,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1ga4hun
books,I just finished Voices From Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexievich and I don't know what I expected but I didn't expect their ghosts to speak to me.,"I expected it to be stories from the citizens that were evacuated from Chernobyl but this is done like slave narratives. It's their own words. Heartbreaking, traumatizing, terrifying and honestly naive. They all are so blatant that they were simple people that didn't understand, didn't know the dangers. The stories made me gasp out loud and tear up. If you are an animal lover stories about how liquidators, that's what the soldiers who were sent to Chernobyl were called, had to dispose of them will make you cry. But the animals; cats and dogs and livestock were suffering so much. 

If anyone else has read this I'd be interested in their thoughts. I've read lots of technical books about Chernobyl that give background of nuclear power around the world and especially the disasters Russia experienced before Chernobyl and was familiar with the basic stories because of those books. But reading this side of it, especially the wives of the firefighters absolutely broke me.

books,"You guys recommended For Whom the Bell Tolls, so I read it and I loved it.","About a month ago I made a post praising A Farewell to Arms, claiming it was probably one of my new favorites, and in the replies, many people were recommending ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""The Sun Also Rises"". So, I read For Whom the Bell Tolls, and thank you to everyone who recommended it! Though I didn't love it quite as much as A Farewell to Arms, it was still outstandingly good. 

First off, I love the building of the characters. Most of the book is either conversations about various different subjects, or Robert Jordan thinking to himself. While this sounds like mere ""filler"" (trust me, it wasn't), it built up the realism of the characters and made them so much more interesting. It made them feel like real characters, and not just like holograms to convey a story (which is a complaint I find with a lot of books). Because of so much time being spent with the characters conversing in a cave, it almost has the feeling of actually being there. It has this genuine and authentic feel that makes you understand that this is partially autobiographical! To me, Hemingway had a huge talent for making authentic-feeling stories.

Another thing that impressed me was its suspense. I don't mean scary suspense like Blood Meridian, but more so intense, riveting engagement that keeps you hooked. For the climax of the novel (which I will not spoil), suspense was built up so well. Almost the entire book is technically a lead-up to the climax, but the last 5 or so chapters before the climax are so well built. It puts such a good focus on the character's mental state and every action they do, before they are about to do the main goal of the story. Every action and thought is just described so wonderfully and makes it so amazingly immersive. 

This is all I can think of for now, since I just finished it and I'm still collecting my thoughts, but thank you so much for recommending this everyone!

books,Is “The Honey Witch” by Sydney Shields Worth Persevering? ,"No spoilers please!

I was so hyped for this book. I adored the concept and I willingly fed into the hype around the release. I also want to preface this by saying that I feel like I am generally able to turn my brain off to mediocre writing. I enjoy Sara J Maas books easily enough, I was a sucker for Twilight as a youth, I have even been invested in fanfic from time to time so I don’t think I am a “snob” when it comes to writing. 

But holy shit I am three chapters in and it LITERALLY has put me to sleep! I am so disappointed! I feel like the concept is interesting and some of the prose are decent but I just want to throw this book in a PDF file and edit while I read. 

1. There is ZERO tension. It’s as though the author is afraid that if she doesn’t exposit  *before* she provides detail, that the reader will be confused? 

Example: There is a scene where (character) arrives, and we are explicitly told exactly who it is right before the author describes overhearing the conversation the character is having. It removes sense of mystery and just seeks to validate the answer already given. So much of the story is like this! The reader isn’t allowed to remain curious or confused or (god forbid) SPECULATE for more than a few sentences. 

2. Everything moves so fast. I truly feel like I’ve got whiplash reading this book and I’m like 30 pages in. The writing feels eager to move at a breakneck pace no matter the scene. What I would consider to be some pretty seemingly significant moments have just been eagerly exposited and handled in only a few pages. Like SLOW DOWN, girlypop. So many things that have happened so far should have me eager to read more but they been thrown out so fast I have no time or interest in caring about them? 

It feels like the author is checking off elements in a list instead of telling a story. I can only hope that the intro is rushed so that we can reach the true “meat and potatoes” of the story that she is actually interested in writing about. 

I really want to believe that the story gets better but I am losing faith rapidly. 

Was anyone else disappointed by the start of *The Honey Witch*? Does it get better? It is possible that it gets *worse* ???

The library is one of the greatest gifts to humanity.","In a year, I finished reading about 52 books. Of these, about 12 were from my personal purchases (physical books and audiobooks), while about 40 came from the library.  So let that sink in, a normal book costs $10 to $15, but I'll assume each book costs $20 because I also borrow textbooks, which are more expensive than ordinary books. So, 40 books at $20 each equals $800. This means I save about $800 a year because of the library. But if I calculate the total number of books I borrowed from the library, both finished and unfinished, I checked my loan history and found that I borrowed about 120 books. That would cost $2,400. So, the library helps me save a lot of money. Now, Youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, ps5, ps4 ,Nintendo Switch consume much of my time. However, if I want to learn in-depth topics or great stories, books are still number one in my heart, and the library is one of the greatest inventions.

books,Experienced mystery readers: Which mystery/detective books totally surprised you? Like the clues were there but you still didn't see the twists coming?,"I'm a newbie mystery reader. I am not going to name the book I was reading but only to say it was written by Michael Connelly. This was a few weeks ago.

Anyhow I was quite impressed and talking about the book with some people online. Was having a chat with someone online who called themselves a ""veteran mystery reader"" and they had read the same book. But unlike me, they had been able to guess the ending and that said the twists did not surprise them except one. 

I was impressed by this person's intelligence, but they said that it was actually because the book was not that good at all. Like the one twist that surprised them was basically because the author ""cheated,"" and misled the reader by holding back vital information. So that if you go back and read over what was written, the clues you needed to see the twist coming weren't there. 

So I was thinking about that book again today and decided to make a post to see what experienced mystery readers would consider books that are full of twists but they're done very well. Like if you go back and read it over again, you can see the clues and you don't feel cheated. but despite your experience, you did not guess right and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and ending.

books,No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy ,"I have read Blood Meridian first and have seen the movie multiple times. So I was excited to get into this one.  

I have to say the dialogue in this book was amazing. To see how all the characters spoke to each other plainly. Such as Moss’s relationship with his wife. And the sheriff trying to figure out what happened. 

This book gives an anxious and paranoid feeling throughout. You see a hunter becoming the hunted. I sort of made the connection that this was Cormac’s take on the most dangerous game. 

First off Cormac McCarthy knows how to write villains!!!! Anton Chigurgh was evil!!!!! He was on a mission through and through. To see him just plain out kill and be ready to take someone’s life on a coin toss or their beliefs was quite insane. What resonated me the most is when he makes to Moss’s wife and he said it is what it is. That was so sad she did not deserve that. 

Bell was a lot more fleshed out. His WW2 story about running away. Now him solving this crime he wants some sort of closure. By far my favorite character. 

Moss was an idiot. I would have been in Jamaica by that point. I don’t know if chigurh would have found me but who cares. 

I think McCarthy does a great job with character development. Both of his books had master class villains. It’s such a cruel cruel world he paints.

books,Do you read the foreword / introduction? Does it depend on how new the book is?,"A few minutes ago I decided that The Man in the High Castle is going to be my next read and my first Philip K. Dick experience. I saw the book had an introduction and I thought I’d read that before bed. One of the last books I read was Once Upon a Time in Hollywood by Tarantino himself. At first, I was unsure about it, but the foreword made a compelling case for novelisations. It also made me appreciate how wonderful an introduction can be written and how much it can enhance your experience. 

But with classic books like The Man in the High Castle (as I just found out) often have an educated explanation of the story and its messages in the foreword.

books,Defending Cozy Fiction,"Recently I’ve got into the habit of reading cozy fantasy – relaxing stories without violence and with little to no stakes. Travis Baldree, Becky Chambers etc.

I find cozy fiction to be a most welcomed break from reality, as well as from the traditional narratives of popular fiction: action, crime, mystery etc. It is understandable in that regard, that many people may find cozy fiction boring or pointless, because, why read a story that has no obstacles or action?

But I’d like to defend cozy fiction in that regard. We live in a world that is constantly moving, most of us in first-world capitalist societies, where the hunt for opportunities and for a better life is constant, and ends up eating people from the inside. Combine this with the various threats of modern life, like political polarization, climate crisis, social and economic instability, a crushing work culture, and I believe it is pretty understandable why people turn to a book like *Legends &amp; Lattes* to relax and spend their evening.

Action and drama are great, but coziness and calmness should also be part of our daily lives and our reading culture. It is why many people play Minecraft or watch Miyazaki’s films. A story doesn’t need to have great action and/or violence to be compelling. Sometimes is better to take a step back and enjoy the small things in life: drinking a coffee at your favorite café, reading a book you like, or going in a stroll through the woods with your robot friend while talking philosophy. Our lives tend to be quite action packed and stressful – there’s no need for the entirety of our fiction to be the same.

Today cozy fiction represents a generally small part of the overall literary world I believe, and I hope it will expand in the years to come. We’ve seen enough stories about war, violence and apathy. It’s time to hear stories about sunshine, peacefulness and empathy. Because a human being usually needs both in order to properly exist in a civilized society, and we have given too much room to the first one.     ",A_Guy195,1g93wzl,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g93wzl/defending_cozy_fiction/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g93wzl/defending_cozy_fiction/,2024-10-21 23:22:32,247,0.72,247,0,196,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g93wzl
books,The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson ,"I got introduced to David Grann due to killers of the flower moon. I wanted similar genres so that’s how I discovered this book. 

This had to be one of the most densest books I have read in all time. I bought it in January and just finished this. It felt a bargain though as two books in one. One about planning, marketing and execution of an urban development. As well as one of the craziest and delusional killers of American history. 

I was a fan of Burnham. I thought he was efficient leader and had a great vision. I wanted him to cross paths with Holmes! I felt like the other architects were also like we gotta get in our bags our names are on the line. I really liked how this book painted Chicago. I felt with them finding out they got the worlds fair, building the Ferris wheel, root’s wedding and funeral, and the Buffalo bill show bringing in the biggest crowds! 

I felt the opening with burnham being on the Olympic we knew the painter was on the titanic was so sad! 

Now Holmes was highly insane. Yet his debts were his downfall was crazy. He just thought he could keep getting away with it. He was out here stealing wives. You feel bad about the statistic of all the young women who were lost in Chicago during that time. I think what scared me the most was his big furnace and that poor girl’s footprint in the vault. I did know most of his story before on the morbid podcast. But I felt it was quite definitive in Holmes story. Im glad he got caught. I sort of expected more with his hotel.  

By the end of the book I started to appreciate the world’s fair. All its accomplishments and what came of it. The people coming together to make something great. All that it did for urban development. Chicago must be phenomenal.

books,"Finished my 3rd Adam Neville book, Cunning Folk","I had previously read The Ritual and Last Days. Both of which I think I preferred.

Reading Cunning Folk I actually was under the impression it must have been one of his earlier books. The prose was too much for little finished product. A lot of flowery language and poeticisms in an attempt to capture the dreamy, noxious, and haunted atmosphere...but instead of really imparting that feeling to me, it just fell flat. Instead of really having a picture painted or feelings imparted, it was just murky and long winded in places.

I also felt the pacing and tension building in Last Days was much better.

It kind of reminded me Anne Rice's prose shift in Tale of the Body Thief. I feel she had been very successful and self-assured so she started being more grand in her descriptions, when really pruning and being more exacting would've been better.

I get what he was trying to do...trying to lure the reader into the disgruntled haze of impending doom that his character was in mentally, but whereas other authors have been able to successfully do that for me, with this style I just felt a bit bored and confused...not confused in a good way, but just detached from the story. 

However, someone else on here told me Cunning Folk was their favorite of his...so it truly is subjective. To each their own!

And on a more positive note, I still loved the concepts and basic plot. I really like folk horror and Neville always provides. 

I might take a break from his books until next year, but I definitely want to check more of his folk horror ones out.",cMeeber,1g8uled,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g8uled/finished_my_3rd_adam_neville_book_cunning_folk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g8uled/finished_my_3rd_adam_neville_book_cunning_folk/,2024-10-21 16:55:32,16,0.92,16,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g8uled

books,Finished The Book Thief – and it left me in tears ,"I just finished The Book Thief, and I didn’t expect it to leave me this emotional. I went in knowing it was a sad book, but no book has made me this emotional since *Flowers for Algernon*, but as I read, I found myself crying throughout the book. It wasn’t even one big moment—I’d be reading, and tears would well up, falling here and there as different parts of the story unfolded.

I didn’t connect with every character, but I related to a few specific traits. Liesel’s love for books and her regrets of not taking action (not kissing Rudy) really hit home for me. It made me remember all the regrets I have for not taking action in some situations.

Hans Huberman’s quiet, steady nature, the way he handled everything with such calmness and care—made me appreciate him and I aspire to become the kind of person he was.

The book started out feeling so wholesome (after the initial sadness), but as it progressed, it got darker while still keeping some of those heartfelt moments. It made me think about how words can both save and destroy, and how some relationships can provide light even in the darkest times. I guess it’s one of those stories where you don’t realize how much it’s affecting you until you’ve finished, and then it all comes crashing down.

Also, recommend some books like it that are a roller-coaster of emotions if you can.",lMFCKD,1g8j1yy,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g8j1yy/finished_the_book_thief_and_it_left_me_in_tears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g8j1yy/finished_the_book_thief_and_it_left_me_in_tears/,2024-10-21 06:11:32,276,0.89,276,0,75,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g8j1yy

books,"A world of weird: A.E Van Vogt's ""The Silkie"".","Well another day and another very strange scifi novel read. The novel completed today is A.E Van Vogt's ""The Silkie"".

A Silkie, in Van Vogt's mind, is a creature that can easily move through space, water and land. They can think like a computer, etherically communicate, and can even change their form in order to suit certain changing situations.

But were they actually what they were all to be? Are they actually a creation of man to be heirs or helpers, or ""ringers"" for some world in outer space or conspiracy against humanity?

The Silkie's themselves don't actually know either.

Van Vogt was one of several golden age writers I was really interested in reading, and even got some of his material on a wish list. And this novel marks the first time I've gotten to read some of it.

""The Silkie"" is a pretty short one, only about 191 pages. The story is really fast paced, tight and also full action. And it's also pretty strange! Like it's pretty dreamlike and hallucinatory for a novel written by a golden age writer like Van Vogt, though I can pretty well grasp that much of his work is pretty much like that. And of course he was cited by Philip K. Dick as an influence. Plus he was also a strange person giving his fascination with certain theories, even including the whole Dianetic's thing that was conceived by the infamous L. Ron Hubbard (also a science fiction writer).

But back to the book. ""The Silkie"" has also this feel to it that really reminds of the scifi tv shows of the late fifties and the sixties (the book was published in 1969 after all), you know things like Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"" and Gene Roddenberry's original ""Star Trek"" (of which I saw a few episodes of) and such like. It seems that the inspiration for the story came from the legend of the selkie, a shape changing creature of Celtic myth. I probably can guess that Van Vogt came across this legend at some point and right then and decided to write a science fiction book inspired by it.

""The Silkie"" is a pretty strange book, and very short, but I found it to be very enjoyable. Still got another of his books that I have yet to read and really hope to get more of them soon!",i-the-muso-1968,1g8aeal,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g8aeal/a_world_of_weird_ae_van_vogts_the_silkie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g8aeal/a_world_of_weird_ae_van_vogts_the_silkie/,2024-10-20 22:04:59,35,0.85,35,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g8aeal

books,The Name of the Rose ,"Does anybody else get the feeling the monks talk just like professors and graduate students?  I feel like u can replace ""monastery"" with ""university,"" ""monk"" with ""assistant professor,"" ""abbot"" with ""dean,"" the different religious observances with class, etc. and the book would still mostly make sense.  

The book overall was really amazing, but the last few pages was disappointing, though I find this to be true of most good books in English. William is really smart but fails horribly in everything he undertakes. Bernard Gui is evil and bad and succeeds in all his endeavors. Adso is sweet but he was directly responsible for the fire in which many innocents died or were injured. He keeps flipping over the lamp which he already did at least once before. I don't know why he couldn't let William fight Jorge alone while holding the lamp SAFELY at a distance. I'm sure William was capable of taking down a blind 80 something who was busy committing suicide and probably already further debilitated from actively eating linen soaked in poison. I think William is right, adso is stupid. 

The other thing I didn't understand was why didn't William and Adso try to save Abo and instead chose to stick around and have a long conversation with Jorge? Was it just because Jorge said Abo was beyond help? That seems like a flimsy reason that borders on excuse to leave Abo to his fate while William tried to get the book from Jorge. 

Lastly, was the thing with the book and Jorge an open secret among the monks? What was the deal with Alinardo and the Italian faction going to see Abo just before the night of the fire? Did they know Jorge was behind everything and feel that Jorge had finally gone too far? Or was it because the position of librarian had opened up and they wanted an Italian in that position? 

I wish Eco had gone deeper and further with the plot around abbey politics and the position of librarian. But it felt like the book ended just as that aspect of the book was being developed. 

Nonetheless the book was a page turner on top of being super educational. I'm planning on reading Foucault's Pendulum next.",quantcompandthings,1g84w0r,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g84w0r/the_name_of_the_rose/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g84w0r/the_name_of_the_rose/,2024-10-20 18:05:28,85,0.85,85,0,37,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1g84w0r
books,White Noise by Don DeLillo and the internet,"I just read this book and it struck me that many of the passages from it feel like they're about the internet. Here's something one character says: 

""TV offers incredible amounts of psychic data. It opens ancient memories of world birth, it welcomes us into the grid, the network of little buzzing dots that make up the picture patterns. There is light, there is sound. I ask my students, 'What more do you want?' Look at the wealth of data concealed in the grid, in the bright packaging, the jingles, the slice of life commercials, the products hurling out of darkness, the coded messages and endless repetitions, like chants, like mantras. 'Coke is it, coke is it, coke is it.' The medium practically overflows with sacred formulas if we can remember how to respond innocently and get past our irritation, weariness and disgust."" 

There's an even larger mass of data on the internet today than on TV in the 80s. The description of mantras especially applies to tiktok, in which certain sounds go viral and are endlessly repeated. 

There's also the element of disasters being broadcast widely, which is again even more applicable on the internet. You see videos of horrific tragedies all the time. 

Another theme in the book is the blurring of reality and simulation. The internet spreads so much fake news, especially stuff that makes people scared. Like, Qanon is a whole community of people living in this fantasy world completely disconnected from anyone they know IRL. People live fake lives online too, it's so easy to lie on the internet. And there's also parasocial relationships which the internet lends itself to very well.

Anyways, I'm curious if anyone else has thoughts on how this book connects to the modern internet and consumer culture.

books,That One Book I Loved Before... But Now Can’t Stand,"I recently re-read The Secret Dreamworld of a shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella and I certainly didn't like it, like the first time around.  The main character is just so annoying, where she makes bad financial choices one after the other. And I get it, that this is the theme, but the way she describes or rather excuses her choices is just appalling to me, her behavior reminds me of a kid

books,Great villians: M 'lady,"
In the context of great villains of all time, I think ""milady"" is overlooked. She's a great spy who fools and challenges the musketeers through 3 books. They never get a handle on her because she takes advantage of the assumptions about her - she is assumed to be weak within the culture, she plays against trope. She is conniving, clever, and ruthless in an environment that expects her to be simple, naive and demure. She is often one step ahead of Athos and even Richelieu. I don't see her talked about a lot, but I think she is one of the greatest villians of all time.

books,The Glass Castle: What was wrong with her parents?,"I just finished reading Jeannette Walls' *The Glass Castle*, and it was both an eye-opening and a challenging experience. The book really makes you reflect on things we often take for granted. But it also left me with a lot of questions, particularly about her parents' mental health.

Jeannette's father was an alcoholic and seemed delusional at times, but despite his flaws, I thought he still cared about his children, especially Jeannette. However, that belief was shattered when he allowed her to go with a drunk man, where she was nearly sexually assaulted. When she told his father about it, he showed no remorse, guilt, or anger toward the man. Similarly, he ignored what happened to Brian when he was almost molested by his grandmother (Edit: His dad's mother)

As for Jeannette's mother, she came across as depressed, carrying a lot of regrets, which seemed to contribute to her selfishness and lack of action. When Uncle Stanley tried to assault Jeannette, her mother didn’t protect her or punish him. Instead, she pitied Stanley, thinking he acted that way because he was lonely. I don’t understand why her mother didn’t leave her father, especially when Jeannette suggested it might give them a better future.

At the end of the book, her mother says that life with her husband was ""never boring."" What does that mean? Did she prefer the chaotic and dysfunctional life they lived over a more stable and safe one for herself and her children?",nik1here,1g7pdx1,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g7pdx1/the_glass_castle_what_was_wrong_with_her_parents/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g7pdx1/the_glass_castle_what_was_wrong_with_her_parents/,2024-10-20 02:59:02,302,0.92,302,0,81,0,0,False,False,True,True,True,,nsfw,t3_1g7pdx1

books,The rising lack of editing- what is going on?,"Maybe it's my fault for thinking they'd be good, but I'm honestly shocked at how poorly edited some of the releases from TikTok creators, podcasts hosts or other influencers are. I'm currently reading a new release from a TikTok personality that had a pitch that sounded fun, especially for Halloween, but it's SO let down by the lack of editing or even cohesive flow. The characters smirk, shrug, sigh and slouch so often it sounds like they have physical tics. 

Another release hyped up last year was The Butcher and the Wren, from Morbid cohost Alaina Urqhart, which apparently never had a single critical eye passed over it. It's genuinely one of the worst books I've ever read, the prose and pacing is sloppy and again- barely cohesive. 

Then of course there's the most notable lemon of all that inexplicably gained enough traction to be picked up by a trad pub - Gothikana. Apparently written by Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, it's like an AI generated text but I wouldn't even give the author enough credit, and it seemed to have absolutely no overhaul before being published. 

There are definitely outliers here- for example All Good People Here is another podcast host author but was much tighter, not full of nonsense passages and irrelevant arm flailing, huffing or smirking.

So truly, WHAT is going on with editing these days? Or is even just proofreading too much to ask for?

books,"I just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars, and I have to say, the film adaptation does an incredible job of capturing the essence of John Green’s novel.","One of the things I loved most about the book is Hazel Grace Lancaster's voice. She's incredibly relatable, with her sharp wit and deep introspection. Green does a fantastic job of blending humor and heartbreak, making you laugh while also hitting you with profound truths about life and mortality. Hazel’s perspective on living with cancer and her desire to lead a “normal” life really resonates, especially when you consider how illness can shape identity and relationships.Gus Waters charm and optimism contrast beautifully with Hazel. The way their relationship developed felt really genuine and raw, capturing the intensity of young love amidst the backdrop of their struggles. Green's writing beautifully illustrated their emotional connections, making me root for them.

John Green is already himself known for addressing tough topics in a way that feels accessible and heartfelt. And his ability to articulate the thoughts and feelings of young adults facing difficult realities and expressing it in a beautiful way is of what made me write this review.

books,Tess of the D'urbervilles messed me up,"I admit that I'm not very familiar with the other works of Thomas Hardy other than some of his poems, but recently, I went into Tess of the D'ubervilles completely blind, and boy, did that story like a punch to the gut at every turn. 

I got so mad that Hardy didn't give Tess a happy ending, but he made his point about the moral standards of women in the Victorian era. (Also, on a side note I love the irony of a person named Angel who doesn't treat Tess like an Angel, simply because she got raped, which she had no control over). Furthermore, she's punished every time she tries to ""move up"" the social class, so to speak. I found an intresting fact: the literal meaning of Tess is ""to reap,"" or at least according to Wikipedia. When she violates this fate ordained even within her name, tragedy awaits her in the form of Alec (also another thought: could Alec be in reference to Alexander the Conquerer?). In any case, Tess is one of those few books that really fucked me up.

Am I going mad? Or is my australian perspective on this word different to other countries?

Edit e.g. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pJmVLQyd6U&amp;t=4s) is an example of how i've always pronounced it. I'm guessing it's an Australian/NZ thing then?

books,Babel,"Let me summarize nearly 800 pages for you: ""colonialism, racism, and sexism are all bad, and were especially bad in 1830s England with the added bonus of classism at Oxford.""

That's it, that's the whole book.

I should have followed my gut around 100-150 pages in when I was thinking ""surely the entire book is not this hamfisted, right?"". No, it is. And I won't even touch on the suspension of disbelief necessary for this argentogravure stuff. Like the entire world is normal, except that? At least with Harry Potter you're allowed to believe the world exists because it's entirely magic, but here it's just this? It didn't resonate.

Back to my main gripe: if you want to be hit over the head every 40 pages or so with ""colonialism bad"", then by all means take the dive. But what did this book teach me that I didn't already know? It's set in 1830s Oxford...of course there are racists, sexists, and classists, and of course these things are bad. What did this explore that hasn't been explored? There was zero subtlety in the entire thing. I felt like I was reading a long form post from r/im14andthisisdeep or something.

The characters were also somehow not believable at all. The only one that felt believable and well written was Ramy.

I've read plenty more that had more to say on the main topics that this book supposedly deals with. Le Pays des Autres comes to mind, also Le Paradis, hell even Where the Crawdads Sing had more to say about class than this and that too was pretty on the nose.

I bought this because the review said it was an exploration of class, race, etc. in a novel setting. It was, instead, nearly 800 pages of being beat over the head with things we already know against a backdrop of a completely absurd plot to which no real effort is given to explain aside from maybe 5 pages like halfway through: ""slight differences in meaning impute what is missing to the surroundings"".

books,Religious Themes in Shogun - Pachinko ,"I read Pachinko about a month ago and was bothered by the virtual signaling, the scripture quoting and the shifts to erotica from time to time. The whole wives being submissive to their husbands and yadda. I almost gave up reading the book because I was so bothered by it. It wasn’t subtle at all. My sister was reading along with me so I finished the book so we could have our discussion. Now I recently started Shogun after hearing great things about the show. I want to watch it but book first so I can compare, ne? I’m only 10% in I’m already starting to get Pachinko vibes. They have mentioned the word crucifix about 6-7 times in this little bit of book so far and the characters keep on bringing up religious sayings. Mind you the book is anti catholic so far, which doesn’t bother me because I was raised catholic and have big issues with their church as a whole. The travelers that just landed in Japan are to be Protestants and in opposition to the Catholic Portuguese priest already in the village. Some scenes also describe the penis of this one white man as being so endowed and the Japanese women giggling about it in appreciation. The guy has already slept with a courtesan and they seem eager to be seen as Christians as if that was better? I’m usually not bothered by religious themes in a book. I read and loved Life of Pi and recently finished Wolf Hall which talks about Henry the VIII’s push for separating himself from the Catholic Church in order to get his marriage annulled. I don’t mind reading about people having faith but I draw the line when it comes in the shape of scripture quoting and virtue signaling. 
My question is: is Shogun similar to Pachinko in this sense? Catholics bad, Protestants good, praise the lord, mixed in with some gratuitous erotica? I don’t want to spend all these hours reading just to be upset at every turn of the wheel.

books,Anyone else read The Undercurrent by Sarah Sawyer yet?,"Just finished it this morning and enjoyed a lot. It was much slower than I expected. The prose was pretty dense and wasn’t as much a fast read as some thrillers are. I saw it marketed as mystery/thriller but I’d probably align more as a drama/mystery. Sarah Sawyer was much more invested in getting to know the women in the story than keeping a thrilling pace. 

Overall, I thought that was a good approach and I felt like I knew the characters very well by the end of the book. They all felt like people I could and have known in my life. I also liked that the women in the story were shown very completely with both strengths and very apparent flaws. Sawyer painted a pretty rich portrait of how messy and complicated motherhood can be.

books,"You're halfway through a book you don't hate, but are having a hard time staying invested in. What do you do?","I know the frequent (and not bad) advice is to drop books that aren't engaging you, but I feel like it's more nuanced than that, and particularly when you're at or beyond the halfway point. For example I'm in the middle of a book I bought and paid for (used, but still). I don't hate it by any means, but whenever I pick it up on a lunch break at work or during downtime at home, I only manage a few pages before my mind wanders and I set it down again.

Do other people just drop the book at this point? Dedicate an afternoon and plow through it? Skim pages until it's either interesting or it's over? This one's relatively short, but the longer the book the more difficult the dilemma in my experience.

books,Spotify Audiobooks,"So I was looking through some of my apps that I need to delete and I noticed I still had Spotify on my phone, but before I deleted it, I opened it to see if anything changed and something did change. Spotify offers listeners audiobooks. 

As enticing as this sounds, I had to see what the catch was. I looked it up and it absolutely says you can listen to audiobooks on Spotify, but it’s only 15 hours per month on their premium service. 

15 hours isn’t anything right? Maybe one or two books? But I’ve read 6 books between September and now. This can’t be a viable option for people who want to immerse themselves in reading. Or maybe it’s for those who read one or two audiobooks (separate from their normal reading)

I just thought it was ridiculous that they offer that but that’s not anything. I guess for casual reading it is fine but I could not do this unless I was like on vacation or something.

books,Short stories by H.H. Munro (Saki),"**Brilliant short stories from a master!**  
  
I recently decided to stretch my literary horizons by exploring the short story genre, so I began by looking up some lists of classics of the genre. The obvious candidates included well-known favourites from big names like Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, H.G. Wells, Oscar Wilde, O. Henry, Rudyard Kipling, Anton Chekhov, and more.   But there was one name I had not come across before, and I found myself delighted with the short stories I subsequently discovered.  That author is Hector Hugh Munro (1870-1916), who wrote under the pseudonym Saki.    
  
Saki was a British writer who proved himself a master of the short story genre, and whose work is rightly compared favourably alongside O. Henry, another of my favourite short story authors.  He was in part inspired by writers like Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll, and Rudyard Kipling, and in turn influenced others such as P.G. Wodehouse.  Many reviewers make frequent comparisons between Saki, Wilde, and Wodehouse.  
  
Typical of Saki's short stories is a biting satire of the stuffy Edwardian emphasis on etiquette and appearances, which was often given priority above morality.  Animals and children frequently outwit adults, and are used to expose the Edwardian hypocrisy that lurked beneath the outward layers of respectability.  His vocabulary is expansive, and his writing is crisp and stylish.  

Many of Saki's stories have comic elements, and returning buffoon characters like Reginald and Clovis are often used as tools to create points of humour, and to provide witty dialogue and mischief.  Some stories also feature an ironic twist at the end, reminiscent of O. Henry.  Saki accomplishes all this with a real economy of words, because it's rare for one of his stories to stretch beyond 2000 words, and most can easily be read in under 10 minutes.    
  
Saki's short stories can easily be found online on a number of websites, so you don't need to buy a book to check out his work.  Of all the Saki stories I've read so far, these are my personal favourites that I highly recommend: Bertie's Christmas Eve, Clovis on Parental Responsibilities, Cousin Teresa, Esme, Laura, Mrs Packletide's Tiger, Sredni Vashtar, The Baker's Dozen, The Boar Pig, The Feast of Nemesis, The Feast of Nemesis, The Interlopers, The Lumber Room, The Mouse, The Open Window, The Reticence of Lady Anne, The Schartz-Metterklume Method, The Seven Cream Jugs, The Stalled Ox, The Unrest-Cure, The Way to the Dairy, and Tobermory.

books,The Wife Between Us,"Maybe I’ve read too many mysteries, but in one word this book was: Trite. 

The book was marketed as some of sensational thriller with an unexpected plot twist that will make your jaw drop. Yet, the plot was an overused and trite story of a woman who married the perfect guy but he turns out to be an abusive monster. 

Majority of the book was the narrator harping on about how she misunderstood her husband and how terribly sorry she was for making that mistake. 

The two “major” twists were not that big of a deal. Vanessa is Nellie and Emma is Maggie’s sister. Done.

books,A Heart That Works by Rob Delaney — Stunning.,"This is one of those books that like one chapter in I was already excited to talk about it and knew I'd have a lot to say.

I've read Rob Delaney's other book and I certainly don't remember him being such an incredible writer. It did always make me have a soft spot for him, but this one made me truly adore him. What a wonderful man. I know the book is written from his perspective so I'm sure that's part of it, but then I also feel that he really does display his flaws and I love him for it anyway, probably even more than if he hadn't.

It's hard to put into words what made this so striking. Something about the way he wrote about his grief is so raw. I was at the gym a few days ago trying to decide on what book I wanted to listen to next, and suddenly had a strong desire to start this one which I'd only vaguely considered before. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life and it was a hard day. I've been trying to read comforting books but nothing felt like it helped to distract me at all. So I suddenly needed this one. And it was in fact needed.

This is a story about his son Henry's death and his family's grief. It's not the first book I've read about grief at all, but is by far the most staggering. The first chapter hit me in the heart immediately. His visceral descriptions of the pain and horror. I have no children and I can't relate to his experience, which is a part of why I wanted this story. Now I know. I think it's important to understand things that you haven't been through, to have that compassion. 

There's so many fascinating thoughts Rob has in this. I just completely got it. I think we are kindred spirits. I also feel peace when I hear about other people's pain, because then I know I'm not alone. I also have thoughts and opinions surrounding death that he's had. I felt seen by a lot of what he said.

To me this book was a balm for the soul. Especially when so many horrible things are happening in the world, and the election is coming up and I just feel powerless and sometimes hopeless. There was a lot of gratitude here for the everyday people who made Henry's life better. It really reminded me of how much kindness is in the world. Also the relationship with him and his wife, and how much love they have for each other and their children. That was all life affirming. I honestly recommend it if you're struggling right now.

The very last paragraphs in the book were also just perfection. I absolutely agree with his views and it's something I've been coming to terms with as well.

&gt;*I suspect I am a glass of water, and when I die, the contents of my glass will be poured into the same vast ocean that Henry's glass was poured into, and we will mingle together forever. We won't know who's who. And you'll get poured in there one day too.*

P.S. I remember a lot of people being put off by the ending of Catastrophe, then me reading about how his grief influenced it. I never felt any particular way about that finale anyway (except that it was slightly disturbing) but now I really understand and appreciate it. &gt;!If you don't remember or didn't see the series, the two leads swim into a riptide in the ocean and you as a viewer never really know if they'll be okay or not.!&lt;",kristin137,1g56ir2,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g56ir2/a_heart_that_works_by_rob_delaney_stunning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g56ir2/a_heart_that_works_by_rob_delaney_stunning/,2024-10-16 18:32:55,66,0.97,66,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g56ir2

What might cause you to choose to read (or re-read) a book in a second or third language?

As someone who wasn’t raised in a two-language household, I read some books in German (B2/C1) for the challenge/maintenance of language and expansion of vocab. However, I *choose* these books depending on their subject matter and the author’s writing style.

books,"Thoughts on the marketing of Nick Harkaway's ""Karla's Choice"" as a John LeCarré novel?","As a longtime fan of John LeCarré I was saddened by the loss of the author, who kept turning out great books right up until the end of his life. I was intrigued to see that his son, Nick Harkaway, would be continuing some of his stories and characters, however I note that this idea has met with fairly mixed reviews among fans.

Personally I am not opposed to the idea, I've read one of Nick Harkaway's books (The Gone-Away World) and enjoyed it, but it was also a completely different genre and style than LeCarré, it was a wild and weird post-apocalyptic adventure story. so it will be interesting to see how he adapts to his father's much more subtle and suspenseful approach to writing. There's also the fact that LeCarré himself drew from his own substantial real experience and connections in espionage while Harkaway, as far as I know, does not have that background. But I'm still planning to buy the book and give it a fair shot.

That said I think putting the phrase ""A John LeCarré novel"" on the book cover is not a great move by the publisher. I don't think it's outright illegal or anything, clearly there's precedent with the many posthumous ""Tom Clancy novels"", but it still rubs me the wrong way, like they are turning him into a brand, it's just kind of gross to me.",Disparition_2022,1g53ybm,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g53ybm/thoughts_on_the_marketing_of_nick_harkaways/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g53ybm/thoughts_on_the_marketing_of_nick_harkaways/,2024-10-16 16:45:16,38,0.95,38,0,28,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g53ybm

* Harry Potter- Had so many life lessons without being preachy for a middle schooler- courage, loyalty, friendship, etc.
* A Thousand Splendid Suns- Cried so much in this book. Saw the toll that wars takes on Women's Rights and Freedoms. Was so beautiful to read about the transformation of the women's feelings from being wary and hostile to becoming best of confidantes.
* Secret Seven/ Famous Five- Pure childhood nostalgia. Loved the description of the picnics and food and adventures lol
* Pride and Prejudice/ Wuthering Heights- Self explanatory. What wouldn't I do to be able to experience the feelings for the first time again that Mr. Darcy and Heathcliff evoked in the teenaged me.
* Gone with the Wind- I am struck by my evolving perspective of Scarlett every time I read this book, depending on my phase in life.

books,"On the road to glory: Robert A Heinlein's ""Glory Road"".","So it's been a while since I've read anything by Robert Heinlein. But tonight I have read and finished another one of his novels, 1963's ""Glory Road"".

In this one we follow Gordon, who had done a tour of combat in Southeast Asia, who one day finds an ad in the personal section of a newspaper. An ad that asks ""ARE YOU A COWARD?"", and states the requirements that lists for whatever job is at hand. And of course Gordon answers it and goes to the address listed on it.

When he arrives he meets a beautiful woman he has ever met. But this woman has many names, and she takes Gordon on the most fantastic adventure that he has ever experienced before! Through different worlds and many perils, before and after!

This is what a lot people claim to be Heinlein's true fantasy novel. Though for me, I think it fits with the science-fantasy mold, which kind of fits a bit better. This ones pretty good also. It's funny, fast paced and incredibly entertaining. And with the touch that only Heinlein could give it!

I can easily believe this to be a satire on the epic fantasy genre, the kind of fantasy made famous by writers like Tolkien and E.R. Burroughs. One that is a bit tougher and grittier, but is really loads of fun to read! This book is going on the list of the most fun and entertaining books I've ever read, period!

books,"Thoughts after finishing ""As I Lay Dying""","I'm usually a scifi fantasy guy. I like wizards and aliens and shit. Unfortunately, my partner has read a lot of my suggestions and cashed in her credit to make me read Faulkner. There are worse fates. Here are my thoughts, which are as disjointed as the narration:

Everyone in this family sucks. Everyone in this family suuuuuuucks. The only exception is Vardaman, who is too young to suck.

In the beginning, as mom Addie is dying, dad Anse insists on sending half the kids off on an errand to earn three dollars. He repeats this a lot. (Actually, every character repeats everything a lot. I can't tell if this is because they're infuriating or because that's how people talked a hundred years ago.) I thought: ""Well, they're simple rural farming types, and it's probably a big deal to them to earn the modern equivalent of like $300."" There is a lot of grumbling from people in and out of the family about trading $3 for the ability to be present while a family member dies, but hey, it's not my place to judge. Then after a while I decided to plug $3 in 1928 dollars into an inflation calculator and *holy shit it's only $55 in 2024*. That's it. Man, there's poverty and then there's greed and idiocy.

Every time a character insulted Anse, to his face or not, was very satisfying to me.

It's fascinating how much interiority and emotional depth the children had given how awful both their parents are.

Seeing how language changes over time was super interesting (cows ""low"", not ""moo""; they'd say ""you bring me that"" whereas we'd say ""bring me that""; countless other little things). Even more interesting was seeing all kinds of things that didn't change, that I'd have expected to be more modern.

I'm not an English major but I suspect this was the first or at least a major early influential example of multiple narrators, which clearly casts a very, very long shadow on modern lit. Cool to see.

I tackled this book by reading the sparknotes chapter summary before each chapter. This cost me some tiny window of spoilers, but it didn't bother me here, because the alternative was not understanding major events at all. The writing isn't shakespearean-level difficult, but a lot of seriously important plot points are written so obtusely that I couldn't notice them even while watching for them after the summary. I highly recommend this strategy for anyone who wants to engage with this or similar works without struggling so much it becomes unfun.

Also, there were neither wizards nor aliens by the time I finished, which was very disappointing.

books,The People in the Trees &amp; Hanya Yanagihara ,"Just finished *The People in the Trees* by Hanya Yanagihara. Man, what an explosive debut! The idea itself, of immortality gained through a turtle, would be interesting on its own. But combined with themes of imperialism, sexual assault, and exploitation, it became this read I couldn’t put down. Although the writing is first-book material, the rhythm of the prose and the pacing more than made up for it.

	On the sexual assault front, there was plenty of inspiration drawn from Lolita with the frame narrative of his arrest and the autobiographical nature of his account. You begin to doubt him more and more after he returns to the States, and the lack of guilt becomes more and more apparent. I saw the inclusion of SA present in the entire book as an analog to imperialism as it is exploitation of an innocent victim purely for the gain of the perpetrator. It did seem somewhat gratuitous at times, although nowhere near the levels of A Little Life. 

	Connecting the two books is apples to oranges, as Trees is certainly more of a plotted adventure, with a distinct A to B plotline. I found Trees to be far better on almost every front; I even wished that it had the length of A Little Life. The nature of his parenting being the clearest candidate for more detail, and perhaps to weave more of his exploits better together. Though the book was dark and graphic at points, Yanagihara put more weight into *WHY* they happened as opposed to what is happening. However, I would not recommend this to a sensitive reader. 

	The racial dynamics in the subtext were interesting as well. Nearly every relationship is defined by a power struggle, from Norton’s with his brother to the nature of lab work and funding. I think that in general, the book takes more of a status quo view, seeing as the narrator is a white male in the mid-20th century and free to pursue whatever pleases him. There’s certainly a lot of envy towards others, projections placed by Norton onto seemingly everyone besides those he wishes he could be. 

	Overall, I greatly enjoyed this book, and honestly wish that it received the same attention as A Little Life. It’s done in far greater taste, crossing the boundary without necessarily being offensive. What does everyone else think, especially when compared to A Little Life?

If feel like it could be a contemporary story.  It doesn't feel like sci-fi.  Several other ones have tried feel the same way.  I think they want to build a world and make it gritty but I want sci-fi.  
Another great example is Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars trilogy"".  It is good but feels heavily political and philosophical rather than sci-fi.

Why do people even think that way? 

I almost never read dark romances except when they delve into more psychological sides of romance like inferiority complexes and other conditions. The last one I picked up had a ‘dark’ cover. The posture of the models and the design implied a power imbalance and maybe some partner worship. I went to the reviews and readers were bashing the main characters for their toxicity.

books,"Have you ever been pleasantly surprised by a ""guest room book""?","I was thinking about the books I've come across in guest rooms over the years (at rental properties, an out-of-town friend's place, etc.). Not books I was planning to read, but that I found myself enjoying.

Here are my most memorable:

""The Good Earth"" by Pearl S. Buck - A classic that I'd certainly heard of but never read before. I found a battered copy on a bookshelf in the common area at a B and B. Spent all day glued to it when a storm blew in. Fantastic!

""Dissolution"", ""Dark Fire"" and ""Sovereign"" (first three books of The Shardlake Series) by C.J. Sansom.  I was at a rental property with a loft stacked to the rafters with books (!). Found this series (Tudor England/mystery) and devoured three in a row (they're not short).

""Memoires d'un Tricheur"" by Sacha Guitry. I found this while staying at a hotel in Paris and read it (very, very slowly) in the original French. The more I read, the more my rusty French came back to me which was very satisfying - and it was a good book! 

What strikes me is how much I enjoyed each of these books - despite the fact that I hadn't planned on reading them, in some cases hadn't even heard of them, and they weren't necessarily the sort of thing I'd choose.  It makes me wonder how much of that enjoyment is due to the vacation factor...

2. Check the ToC(if it has one), see if the chapter names stoke the same excitement that the title did when it got me to pick it up.
3. Pick a chapter and read a page or two.

I make my judgment off of that. What exactly I'm looking for in the words depends on the sort of book (and has changed over the years), but here are a few things that jump out to me these days.

1. In fiction: Descriptions of people's manners that are so vivid and on-point that they highlight the author's understanding of how people are.
2. In non-fiction concise, explicit, concrete points being made. (Recently reading Sense of Beauty by Santayana on the strength of this.)
3. Lots more semi-tangibles.

I would Like to ask If anyone of you read Millionaire series from Kimberly Loth? What are your thoughts? I am on a fifth book and the more I read the more I am starting to think that AI wrote those books... Especially when I am seeing so many reels as advertisement and there are mistakes, Like person who made them didnt even read that book 🤷 I also read one post on reddit how there are some pretty serious trauma events in book 1 and in the book they are basically written Like ""ah, life happens"" Like it is not really that a big deal... And that made me think about it even more.

books,Foreshadowing: Subjective Thoughts,"Some authors I find entertaining make good use of foreshadowing.  Steven King comes to mind with the memorable ""Death, but not for you, Gunslinger"" (Dark Tower series, more than once, and more than one death) comes to mind. 

Terry Pratchett, too, but in a different way.  Prachett leave unresolved questions, such as ""Vetenari wouldn't live forever, or perhaps he will use his vampire connection?"", ""What will Little Sam become?"", and ""What happens if Carrot and Angua have children?"".  Pratchett's foreshadowing, if you can call it that, is in hinted questions that may be resolved in future novels (as, for example was the question of the Low King's gender), but sadly will remain unresolved because Sir Terry died young.

I suspect both authors were leaving space for themselves to write into, if that makes sense, and the foreshadowing leaves space for imagination.  

Brutal use of foreshadowing, as common in thrillers, generally irritates me.  It may create dread, which is unpleasant, or may feel manipulative.

books,A continuation of the book from another author.,"Do you know those cases when the sequel to a book comes out in a strange way? 
The same thing happened with the Russian book 'food department'. The book came out in 2019, and already in 2021 there was a series consisting of 8 episodes. 
In short, this is a thriller book about a pioneer camp where some pioneers become vampires and the main character tries to survive the shift there. The vampires there are not quite ordinary, but it was interesting to read. The book has an open ending and at the end of the first season too. The series was quite successful, not a hit, but the atmosphere of summer and pioneer camp, coupled with sometimes unusual twists, was really cool. Yes, and the hidden subtext and the topics raised were unusual.
 I only read the book before this summer, but I watched the series this summer. The second season came out and if I have no problems with this, like everyone earns as they can, then the second book came out next. The first part was written by Alexey Ivanov, the second is being written by another author. It doesn't fit in my head.

The language is lucid and easy to read, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The first 150 pages are engaging, particularly the vivid descriptions of everyday life in Nigeria, which paint a clear picture of the place and its people. The outsider's perspective on the USA is equally insightful.

books,"The Splendid and the Vile : Churchill, Family and Defiance During the Bombing of London","Just finished reading this. Penning my thoughts here. Would love to hear from others who read this or similar books.

The book primarily delves into Churchill's tumultuous early days as Prime Minister of Great Britain during World War II, offering an intimate look into life at 10 Downing Street during the Blitz. Initially, he was very unpopular amongst key political figures in Britain, and many worried that Churchill's chaotic style might not be suited to leading the country through the looming war. Drawing mainly from diary entries from Mary, Churchill's youngest daughter, John Colville, his secretary, Germany's information minister, Goebbel, and other diarists from the Mass Observation movement, the author narrates in a very engaging yet poetic fashion the ongoings of Number 10 Downing Street during the bombing of Great Britain, especially London. It's a fascinating insight into Churchill's amusing quirks like dictating to his secretary whilst lying in a bath tub and personal habits of mandatory naps,  as well as the lives of his so-called inner-circle, who witnessed his behind the scenes strategizing and emotional turmoil whilst the country was being bombed to shreds. The book doesn't narrate the entirety of the war, but paints beautifully the picture of Britain's courage and resilience during the bombing, which is largely credited to one person, Winston Churchill. His larger-than-life personality, attitude, and ability to rally the nation in such trying times are portrayed poignantly. The book also highlights how Churchill’s emotionally charged speeches and interaction with commoners eradicated despondency amongst people and ignited resilience and desire for retribution instead. It was also heart warming to read about Churchill's relationship and interaction with Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins, where seeing Britain's suffering, Roosevelt wanted desperately to help Britain yet he had to keep the well being of his nation as well as the upcoming presidential election in mind. I especially liked all the bits about the various letters and notes all the characters wrote each other. It lent a significant  weight to the narration and gave me goosebumps at multiple points. Overall, this book masterfully balances historical detail with personal narrative, providing a vivid portrayal of Churchill and his inner circle in one of Britain’s darkest hours.

books,Toni Morrison,"I just finished *Beloved*, the first novel by Morrison that I’ve ever read. It took just a couple of days. And WOW! It was mystical, horrifying, and incredibly sad—and worth every second. The format confused me a little at times, but I believe I picked up on most of its meaning.
 
Despite them living lives that are obviously very different from my own, I felt I could understand each character and why they felt or acted in the way they did. Sethe (is it pronounced Seth?) was my favorite. Stamp Paid, too.

It’s the kind of book you need to be prepared for, at least if you’re sensitive to topics of racial injustice, sexual assault, and death. There were several times I felt so disgusted and uncomfortable that I had to take a pause. But I don’t think I could have stopped reading completely, even if I tried. 

It’s great reading by yourself but I think this is the kind of book that would also benefit from group discussion. That’s probably why many schools include it in their curriculum.

books,"Inner monsters: Edward Levy's ""The Beast Within"".","Completed a short but interesting novel tonight by an unknown author by the name of Edward Levy, and it is titled ""The Beast Within"".

So here the story is set in the Ozark Mountain region in the Northwest area of Northwest Arkansas, it starts off with an act of cheating between the wife of a very brutal husband and a salesman, leading to the husband enacting a horrific instance of revenge that ends with the salesman being imprisoned in the cellar for twenty years. And during those years the not-so-innocent salesman becomes increasingly insane and turns into something that is less than human.

Soon he breaks loose and in the process would come to cross pass with a newly married couple and irrevocably change their lives, and leave a legacy that would haunt them.

This is a short book but the contents of it are extremely dark and extremely brutal. I mean there are some pretty gruesome moments in it along with some very spicy moments too. And all done in a very surprising literary way even. That is most likely because of the research that Levy did while he worked on it, which included lycanthropy, parapsychology, animal telepathy (interestingly enough) and Ozark mountain folklore.

And since I mentioned lycanthropy here, yes this is Levy's own take of the werewolf trope in horror. I think I would put this novel in the psychological horror category with a bit of a supernatural twist. Some of the characters that initially appear in the story, especially in the first part of it, aren't particularly that sympathetic, but the young family, the MacCleary's, I really feel for, especially in regards with what is happening to their only son. This is a particularly short but very sharp novel, done in a very literary way. And it of course only one of two novels, that I know of, that Levy had written. The other, ""Came A Spider"" I might have to track down.

books,Some thoughts on Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose,"I just recently read this book and had to share some thoughts about it, to bounce some of my impressions off others who have read it.  
  
For those unfamiliar with it, this debut novel from author Umberto Eco was first published in Italian in 1980, but later became a smash hit around the world in many languages. It's sold over 50 million copies and has received many international awards.  
  
Overtly this book is a murder mystery. It's framed as a story of someone who found a narrative of 14th century events within medieval manuscripts, and despite being entirely fictional, it is presented with real authenticity.  
  
Set over the course of seven days, the basic plot concerns a young Benedictine monk, Adso of Melk, who is conscripted to join the erudite Franciscan monk William of Baskerville as he visits a monastery in northern Italy to witness a theological debate. William is a former inquisitor, and his deductive powers are immediately on display, in a hilarious incident where he divines the whereabouts of a missing horse, in a way that brings to mind Sherlock Holmes at his best. The local abbot asks William to investigate the mysterious death of an illuminator who recently fell from the abbey's library. But from then on, someone at the abbey dies mysteriously daily, apparently following the pattern of apocalyptic judgements found in the book of Revelation.  
  
The key to this mystery appears to lie in a mysterious book (the missing second part of Aristotle's Poetics, in which he discusses laughter) and the labyrinth that holds the abbey's giant collection of books. This library is built like a giant maze and occupies an entire floor of the massive castle that makes up the abbey. As the story progresses, William slowly collects evidence and eventually explores the mysterious labyrinth that is at the heart of the story.  
  
But this is more than just a detective story. It's also seen by many to be an intellectual exploration of what truth is, from theological, philosophical, scholarly, and historical perspectives. Eco himself was a scholar in semiotics, which is the systematic study of sign processes and the communication of meaning. So, it's not surprising that his book has many themes relating to interpretation and meaning, and about the importance of inquiring carefully to determine truth. As he once said, ""Books are not meant to be believed but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it means.""  
  
Many of these themes only emerge in the closing parts of the novel. The character of William represents the importance of rational investigation and logical deduction, which contrasts the dogmatic censorship of some of the other characters, who are determined to keep the secrets of the library closed and hidden. We're encouraged to sympathize with William's approach and to criticize that of his detractors.  
  
Yet there's something ironic about the closing part of the novel. William concedes in the end that while it looked like everything was planned, much of what happened was a result of coincidence and error. It's not that readers are left with loose threads that are unexplained; rather, the chain of events turns out to be more a result of chance than of human decisions. Eco himself says about the novel's conclusion that ""very little is discovered and the detective is defeated."" For this reason, the book is sometimes considered a work of postmodernism.  
  
Certainly, Eco's own remarks about the significance of the novel would appear to support that. The edition I read had a lengthy postscript from the author, with some of his own commentary about the book. He wants each reader to come with their own interpretation, and deliberately doesn't want to interpret things for us. In his view, ""the author should die once he has finished writing, so as not to trouble the path of the text."" But as much as he insists on refusing to give an interpretation of his book, it seems clear that he is making a case for postmodernism, and where the series of deaths in the story are ultimately just a chaotic pattern of multiple causes and accidents, and without real meaning, thus suggesting that the quest for certainty and meaning is often fruitless. Even the chosen title ""The Name of the Rose"" was deliberately chosen to be something neutral and empty, rather than a clue to what the novel is about.  
  
The Name of the Rose is not an easy book to read, because it constantly makes frequent allusions to literature, geography, and history, and is very demanding on its reader. There's a dense cast of characters, often with similar names. Many times we're confronted with entire sentences in Latin, without any translation, adding real obscurity. The style often feels scholarly in tone. At times a lengthy paragraph will go on for an entire page, and the reader must wade through lengthy lists that feel more like a catalogued inventory of a ship's cargo than a novel. Eco has been criticized for all this, but he has stated that he deliberately made the first one hundred pages difficult and demanding, despite suggestions he abbreviate this by friends and editors, because he wanted to eliminate any would-be readers unwilling or unable to persevere and thus be unworthy of his book.  
  
The theological debate over Christ's poverty is particularly central to the novel, because the dispute that occupies the monks concerns whether Christ had been poor and whether this is an ongoing mandate for the church; and also whether the pope or the emperor should hold political authority in Europe. The abbey was chosen as a neutral location, with repetitive from both sides.  
  
I did appreciate the academic and theological flavour of the novel, particularly the account of some of the rhetoric about apostolic poverty (p340ff), which has a historical basis in real debates from the 14th century, and revolved around whether Christians could rightly hold any property. Unsurprisingly this theology appealed to the impoverished masses of the time and threatened the wealth and land ownership of the church. it was condemned as heretical by Pope John XXII in 1323, although the Spiritual Franciscans continued to live by that doctrine. I found this background of these theological disputes stimulating and fascinating.  
  
Despite the theological subject matter, and a setting populated with clergymen, the novel does still venture into some dark moral territory. One of the sub-plots concerns the same-sex passions of a monk in a sexual relationship with another monk. Even Adso himself ends up having a sexual fling with one of the local girls. To be fair, all this is described in a very sober, poetic, and even intellectual way (p.245), so rather than having the feel of a saucy romance novel, it recalls passages of Song of Solomon and similar texts. So even carnal acts are presented in a detached way, and closely connected with spiritual struggles of the soul, and they feel more like poetic and theological observations about virtues and vices than pure smut.  
  
Despite the promise and potential, I still found myself feeling somewhat disappointed by the time the novel wrapped up. There is some excitement in the closing part, including a showdown with the main villain, and a massive fire. And when we discover how all the events unfolded everything does make sense. But is it simply divine justice orchestrating events, as the story's villain believes? Or have multiple causes and accidental happenings contributed to the chain of events more than anything else, as Eco wants us to believe? As a result, there's a sense of postmodern ambivalence and ambiguity about the ending, despite there being no loose ends. Furthermore, even the narrative of final events didn't feel that suspenseful or exciting on a surface level.  
  
The Name of the Rose has turned out to become a surprising bestseller, and a modern classic. It's just a pity that despite its success, it doesn't quite live up to what I was hoping for in the end, and I expected more of a pay-off. But perhaps that says more about my sentiments about post-modernism than it does about this book.",EndersGame_Reviewer,1g1y303,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g1y303/some_thoughts_on_umberto_ecos_the_name_of_the_rose/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g1y303/some_thoughts_on_umberto_ecos_the_name_of_the_rose/,2024-10-12 11:29:38,122,0.92,122,0,58,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g1y303

books,Has reading any book ever scared or disturbed you as much as watching movie? ,"Got into a debate with this guy about how books can be as scary, disturbing, and upsetting as movies. I mean that's my position. He said no, the medium of film is much more immediate. Like you get the visual and the sound together, and more importantly you can't just stop the way you can stop reading a book, which is a more intentional and active activity.

He used the example of the movie Psycho and also Requiem for a Dream, saying a book could never be as intense because authors can't do visual tricks and use music the way those movies do.

I don't agree but can't think of any examples to counter that. Where do you stand? Can you think of any examples where a book can match movies in terms of being upsetting and disturbing?",Hannibalonprozac,1g1vfsk,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g1vfsk/has_reading_any_book_ever_scared_or_disturbed_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g1vfsk/has_reading_any_book_ever_scared_or_disturbed_you/,2024-10-12 08:10:12,493,0.95,493,0,751,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1g1vfsk

books,"What happened to ""The House of the Scorpion"" by Nancy Farmer?","I did not read it as a kid, but I read it a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it.  The concept of a boy who's really the clone of a drug lord and is supposedly raised to eventually inherit said drug lord's empire.  I found the story compelling, the characters well developed, the themes of cloning and the search for personal identity are well represented and explored.  Not to mention the tension, world building, and plot points were well established.  Of course, the sequel ""The Lord of Opium"" leaves a lot to be desired, but ""The House of the Scorpion"" deserves its recognition and accolades (can't miss the 3 medals on the cover).

Why wasn't it more popular?  With a premise like that, why hasn't it already been adapted into a movie or TV series?  It may be considered dystopian, but IMO it's better than Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and Divergent.  There are many more lackluster books and newer books that have been adapted (some hits and misses).  I believe this book deserves its time to shine.

books,Which book/author you had read that turns out to be much more difficult than you expected?,"Putting aside authors that are quite known to be difficult and often discussed here (Pynchon, Joyce, Faulkner and etc..), which author or book you've picked expecting it to be a casual read but ended up struggling with it?

For me as an ESL reader, I can honestly say there are a lot author I am struggling with even though i have been using english since I was a teenager. So, It's not easy me for to get recommendations because there are always a chance that the writing styles while feel normal to everyone else, end up much harder for me.

There was this novel particularly i want to point out. Somebody recommended the book on a post in a horrorlit subreddit and the premise intigued me. Usually with horror the writing styles are not very hard, but with this book (The Dead Path) made me quit after like 10 pages because it's nearly unreadable to me.

Excerpt from the book posted by a goodreads commenter:

*""Nicholas got inside and twisted the car alive. The bones of a city don't change. Perhaps its skin grows tight or flaccid as suburbs grow fashionable of become declassee; crow's feet spread from pockets--new streets, new arteries into fresh corpulence. But the skeleton of its founding roads, the blood of its river, the skull of the low mountain that looms over it with its thorny crown of television towers like its own blinking Calvary...these things hadn't changed.""*

It's not like I dont understand them at all, I do eventually,  but it caused me to read sentences multiples times and slow down, and its hard to get absorbed into the story.

For me this is the biggest barrier in reading novels because i cannot just choose whatever topic and story I am interested about. Do you guys had the same experience? Which author caught you off guard?

books,Elif Shafak - There are Rivers in the Sky ,"(No spoilers) 

Just finished this and loved it. I think Elif Shafak is fast becoming one of my favourite authors, having also read and loved 10 Minutes 38 Seconds and The Island of Missing Trees.

This is certainly the most epic of the three, and I really enjoyed how it followed three storylines across several centuries. I also enjoyed the very slight hint of magical realism.

10 Minutes and 38 Seconds is probably my favourite of the three I've read as it has a dark humour the others don't have.

books,"The secret history, some questions.","I just finished reading The secret history by Dona Tartt. And i have a lot of thoughts and questions so i thought posting here is a good idea, also i read few reviews and a bit of theories so i am really interested in TSH lore.

1. Did they actually kill the farmer? I feel like they might have not killed him and were wrong about it. Making it more tragic.

2. Also about the ritual and stuff so there is a lot of supernatural things happening, did they actually experience all that stuff during bacchanal? Or they just lied?

3. Was Henry trying to frame Richard and kill Charles? And were his feelings towards camilla genuine or was he just manipulating her?

4. Is Henry a psychopath or just a victim of events? I feel like was definitely manipulative but he didn't want to kill Bunny but there was no choice and farmer's death was an accident.

5. The incest ?? Also i feel like in the end charles might have tried to force himself on Camilla. Idk

6.Is Richard genuine or just an unreliable narrator twisting the story? Also what exactly makes Henry to confide in Richard? 

7. Henry killing himself and making the ultimate sacrifice, do you think he redeems himself in that way?

8. Is Julian actually the master manipulator, orchestrating everything? Maybe a part of some ritual. His behaviour was weird and by the end Richard points out some stuff regarding it.

books,To Kill A Mockingbird: please can a USA reader check my (UK teacher) ideas?,"Hi all and thank you in advance.

I'm a UK teacher prepping TKAM for the first time. I have mixed feelings about the book but at the moment I have to teach it so I just want to do a good job. I would love someone with better background knowledge than me to just give a little feedback on these points. Thank you so much.

1. I'm really interested in poverty in the book as a social ill alongside racism. Is it fair to say that poverty in the South in the Depression was traceable back to the Civil War and Reconstruction as well as the Depression itself? The American Civil War is not widely taught here in the UK and I don't think this is on many teachers' radars, but the fact of Alabama being on the ""losing"" side and the collective memory of the Civil War seem quite relevant to the book.
2. To what extent am I right in thinking this is partly a ""giving voice to the voiceless"" type of book? From the viewpoint of 1960s America it might have been easy for some readers to dismiss a poor, racism-ridden town in Depression Alabama as beneath their worldview. Is it fair to tell students that in fact Lee is trying to crack open this image and present a three-dimensional view of the time and place?
3. One of the themes in the book seems to be that the apparatus of government -- education, the courts -- is faulty and does a poor job of people's actual lives. It isn't equal to the social problems on the ground. Is it fair to say this reflects a deeper mistrust between disadvantaged people and the state?

Would love any comments on these ideas. Thank you!

books,What are your thoughts on rebinding antique books that are in poor condition? ,"There's this antique herbalism book from 1889 that I've been eying up and I managed to find a copy. 
However, it is sadly in poor condition with the spine practically falling apart and some pages loose. 
The pages however look to be in good condition. 

I have the skills, knowledge and tools to rebind it but I'd have to take the entire book apart, resew it and possibly even make a new cover for it. 

I was going to rebind it using some fresh book board or wooden boards and some high quality black leather that I have for such special projects. 

It also looks like it's had a bit of repair before too. 

I know that doing this will devalue the book but because of its poor condition, I think that it will give it a new life. 

How do you all feel about doing such a thing to such an old book?

Would you leave it as is, see if someone can do a full restore bringing it back to original condition or do a full rebind knowing that it won't be as valuable any more?

books,Elias Canetti ,"I bought and read Auto-da-Fé a while ago and became very interested in Canetti's ability to write so I read Crowds and Power, and a selection of some of his writings through out his career called I Want to Keep Smashing Myself Until I am Whole, and then I bought the collection of his memoirs because of that book so I'll be reading that soon.  And to note, a book of his is getting an English translation for the first time very soon so I will obviously be getting that since there were snippets of it in the  selection book.  

Auto-da-Fé was an interesting book, I don't like using that word bur it's the best I can think of to describe it.  At the beginning it reminded me of the movie The Phantom Thread due to the main characters self obsession and narcissism, though as you continue to read you realize that every time we follow a new character we are 100% inside their own head and their own world, which took me a minute to figure out but I stuck along with the ride because the writing itself was what kept me going.  It reminded me of how I first read Notes from the Underground, as if in time that I'm not careful I might end up like the main character.  In short, I am glad that I read it but can understand why some people wouldn't want anything to do with it.  I read on the back of the book it was supposed to represent the current climate for European literature so I thought that the main character was a personified caricature of classic literature terrified of no longer having a place in the ever evolving world.

Crowds and Power was a fascinating read, I'm very surprised, or at least have no idea if, Rene Gerard never mentioned or collaborated with Canetti because they have a lot of similar theories when it comes to people and the crowds that follow them.  It delves deep into reasons the human mind may become to manipulated into giving itself to someone else, through mythologies based of already existing human characteristics, to current systems breaking down its people to exploit their obedience.  So many ideas and ways things can happen.  

I Want to Keep Smashing Myself Until I am Whole as I said is selected writings of his but I think is still a good introduction to him, I haven't read all his works but this book includes some other of his writings in regards to his book that aren't included in those books.  I'll be reading his full memoirs soon.

books,Wolf in White Van,"Started and finished this book today, it is a quick read and I was impressed by how engaging it is.  I realize this book is 10 years old now but I'm interested in getting others' thoughts about it.  I checked out the GoodReads reviews which seem to all go along with the assumption that Sean's ""accident"" was &gt;!a failed suicide attempt.!&lt;

&gt;!What Sean did wasn't an accident, but it also wasn't a suicide attempt.  My reading of the book is that he got exactly the outcome he was aiming for.  Here's why:!&lt;

* &gt;!When Sean meets the teenagers in the parking lot, he's asked what the worst part of his disfigurement is.  His answer is not the social isolation, the stares, the inability to eat food normally, but the hearing issue caused by the injury.  The teens are incredulous and ask him if he would rather have a ""more normal"" face or have his hearing fixed, and he says he doesn't know anymore.!&lt;
* &gt;!Sean's total disinterest in having any reconstructive surgery that could give him a normal life.  This might be interpreted as reluctance to have a more experimental procedure done on his face, but I feel like most people in his situation would jump at the chance anyway.!&lt;
* &gt;!He says of his relationship with his father, ""I did something terrible to his son.""  This is a really striking line highlighting, in my view, that Sean killed the boy who was a normal teenager and is now someone else.!&lt;
* &gt;!Similarly, when he is in the hospital, he tells his mother, ""I was going to be lonely anyway.""  At another point in the book, he suggests that he always seems to know exactly how things will play out.!&lt;
* &gt;!Sean hypothesizes that, if things had been different, if he hadn't decided to shoot himself, he might have gotten some mail-order swords and gone on a rampage and become an infamous killer.  Or, equally likely, he might have hung them on his wall and eventually outgrown them.  He imagines telling his mother, ""Do whatever you want with them.  I'm not that person anymore.""!&lt;
* &gt;!He has a perfect moment with Kimmy, kissing her and seeing the beauty of his area, right before he shoots himself.  I interpret this as him realizing that, even in that beautiful moment, he still felt cut off and isolated.!&lt;
* &gt;!Finally, the very last scene of the book.  He pulls the trigger, crying and wondering if that's because he really wants to ""do this"" or really doesn't want to, but it doesn't matter.  The book ends: ""Okay.  There it is.  I am here now.  And then I laid down on my belly and listened to the rising squall beyond my door.""  !&lt;

&gt;!To me, all of this paints a fairly clear picture of Sean's motivations.  After kissing Kimmy, he realized that he would always be a loner, alienated from society and self-isolating.  By mutilating his face in such a dramatic way, he externalizes that alienation.  Nobody questions why he lives by himself and has no romantic partners or friends.  His parents don't pester him to get out of the house more.  He doesn't have to try to go to college, date, get a normal job, or any of other adult things that he knows he will struggle with.  He frees himself from the expectations of being a person that he is not, and becomes his ""true self.""  ""Okay.  There it is.  I am here now.""  !&lt;

&gt;!In his view, the alternatives were to live that life that he wasn't meant for, or to go on a homicidal rampage, and even contemplates killing his parents.  But, in the end, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, as he emphasizes in the letter to Carrie's parents, so he decides to just turn the gun on himself.  Much like the choose your own adventure system of Trace Italian, he chose his own life on his own terms.!&lt;",Ectophylla_alba,1g10mld,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g10mld/wolf_in_white_van/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g10mld/wolf_in_white_van/,2024-10-11 03:22:18,17,1.0,17,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1g10mld

I'm often in my head, so creative descriptions, whether of nature or people or whatever, really helps ground me in the story and bring it to life for me. 

The kind of writing I like is hard to do right, and some authors who want to sound poetic and deep produce work borders on purple prose, but when it's done right, it's amazing.

For instance, this I think is a good example of what I like. This how The Amber Spyglass by Pullman begins:

""In a valley shaded with rhododendrons, close to the snow line, where a stream milky with meltwater splashed and where doves and linnets flew among the immense pines, lay a cave, half-hidden by the crag above and the stiff heavy leaves that clustered below.""

""The woods were full of sound: the stream between the rocks, the wind among the needles of the pine branches, the chitter of insects and the cries of small arboreal mammals, as well as the birdsong; and from time to time a stronger gust of wind would make one of the branches of a cedar or a fir move against another and groan like a cello.""

""It was a place of brilliant sunlight, never undappled. Shafts of lemon-gold brilliance lanced down to the forest floor between bars and pools of brown-green shade; and the light was never still, never constant, because drifting mist would often float among the treetops, filtering all the sunlight to a pearly sheen and brushing every pine cone with moisture that glistened when the mist lifted. Sometimes the wetness in the clouds condensed into tiny drops half mist and half rain, which floated downward rather than fell, making a soft rustling patter among the millions of needles.""

So many of his observations failed to provide any meaningful solutions, and instead felt resigned to just comment on culture elements he felt were detrimental. It felt very pedestrian in a lot of ways, unfortunately.

books,"Symbolism in “Farewell, My Lovely” ","I’ve been reading some Raymond Chandler lately, and I recently read “Farewell, My Lovely”. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and recommend it to anyone interested in the noir genre (though saying you recommend Chandler for noire is like saying you recommend Shakespeare for sonnets, or Asimov for high-concept sci-fi. I mean- duh, right?). However, there was a piece of symbolism that I think went right over my head. Most of the way through the book, before Marlowe (the protagonist) goes to confront the lynchpin of the case, he’s talking to someone at the homicide bureau about the case, and notices a bug with pink spots (hereafter referred to as “the pink bug”) that struggled to find a way out of the room he was in. Marlowe is sort of focused on the bug throughout the conversation, and closes the talk with his colleague (who he’s kind of at odds with) by picking up the bug, taking it outside, and putting it in a bush. 

There’s some juxtaposition a little later on that makes it clear (in my opinion anyway), that the bug is supposed to represent Marlowe’s own tenacity- a creature in an environment not made for him that constantly beats him down and prevents him from reaching his goal, but he struggles on anyway, because it’s all he knows how to do. 

My question is this- at the very end of the book, he flashes back to the bug, and wonders if it’s gone back into town hall by now, and if so, how far along it’s gotten. Why? The line seems kind of out of the place in the ending, which is largely about his relationship with Anne and the kinds of people they both are, and the bug line seems to come out of nowhere. Does anybody have any insight that might explain why Chandler decided to call back to that theme at that moment? Does the bug represent more- or something entirely different- than I thought? Am I reading too much into what was supposed to be a simple analogy in a pulpy-kind of a book? Any insight is appreciated.

books,I need to talk about “we need to talk about Kevin”,"Just finished the book, it was amazing but utterly depressing here are my thoughts:

1. Everyone sucks in this book, Franklin is a naive dumbass who won’t discipline his child,Eva is an arrogant narcissist who resented her son from the word “go”, Kevin is a cold blooded murderer and possibly a psychopath.

2. The way Eva treated Cecilia compared to the way she treated Kevin makes me think she have misandrist tendencies, she clearly wanted a daughter and Kevin definitely picked up on that.

3. Kevin wasn’t properly disciplined, the way he’s so casual about disrespecting his parents especially his mother, and his casual profanity in front of his sister is unacceptable behavior.  

4. I guessed the “twist” pretty early but it still had me doubting 

5. Seriously I hated how arrogant Eva was, I’m sure Franklin was just as bad and her idealization of her late husband is the only reason we don’t see it but seriously that conversation where she talked about how much she hated America sounded like a college freshman trying to sounds cool.

That’s this book. I am irate that I read this long-winded torture porn. I think I finished it out of spite, more than anything. 

The first 30% was pretty good! We had the gothic setting, a sapphic romance, an interesting dilemma. I definitely saw the plot twist coming (seriously, who grows up among thieves and would be stupid enough to think Gentleman wouldn’t pull a fast one?), but I was enjoying it.

Then we get to Maud’s POV. UgHhGhhhhh…

I did not need the entire first third of the novel repeated from her perspective. It also just got so *weird.* Like yes, her life was creepy and tragic and abusive, but it was *so* heavy-handed. Half the time I couldn’t take it seriously, the other half I just felt like I needed a shower. 

And then the plot twists kept coming! Sucksby was the mastermind! Susan and Maud were switched at birth! Maud was really Sucksby’s daughter! Except I could barely enjoy the drama of all the twists because I was so hung up on how contrived and nonsensical the whole scheme was. Like, was it really necessary to throw Sue in the madhouse? She was utterly devoted to Sucksby and would’ve gladly shared the fortune. It just seems like they did that for the sake of the plot.

It's a short story collection.  One of the stories is VERY short.  Two pages.

I would say ""strangely effective"" sums up most of the ones I've read so far.  I haven't finished the book, but I can see that I'm going to, which doesn't happen often with fiction.  His writing is easy to love.  Is all writing at least partly a way of flirting with the reader?  Hmm, saith the Lord.  And it was hmm.

Love is the right word, though.  His writing sticks to you the way meat and potatoes should and never do.  He's good at changing it up, giving you a new perspective, a new ""so THIS is what the story's about"" and then doing it again a few pages later, until you've piled up reasons to think it over like stuffed animals on a bed:  too many, and also never enough.

No insights, fortunately or unfortunately.  But he's not an atmosphericist, like McCarthy, either; his focus is on the relationships between people, not on the critical absurdity of life.  He treats them carefully, too.  He seems to love them all, strange as that may be.

The breakdown of all the tropes to be found in the book really makes me lose a lot of interest in it, to be honest. Maybe it's because it feels like it means a very by-the-numbers narrative that's going to hit all the plot elements that are currently popular?

books,Memoirs of a Geisha ,"Hi y'all, I just finished reading Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden and I just wanted to share some of my thoughts, hope that's ok!

First of all, I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a delightful read and I would recommend it to anyone 16 years or older who is interested in art, history, or beauty, 10/10. 

  
I find it really interesting how Sayuri’s life could’ve been completely different. If, for example, Hatsumomo had become her older sister and not Mameha, she could have easily become just like her. Just as she molded Pumpkin into something she wasn’t, Hatsumomo may have molded Sayuri, too. In the end, I didn’t really like Pumpkin anymore. Hatsumomo made her mean and nasty, which is kind of sad to me. She and Sayuri grew up together, they were friends, and before the end, Sayuri tried to get Pumpkin to remember that. I don’t really want to blame Pumpkin, though; she had a hard life. With Hatsumomo’s cruelty, Sayuri replacing her as the Nitta Okiya’s adopted daughter, and then having to work as a prostitute for two years during the war? That’s enough to turn anyone a bit sour, I suppose. 

And it kind of makes me wonder, if Sayuri didn’t have those beautiful blue-gray eyes of hers, how different would her fate have been? Would the chairman have taken notice of her crying at the river and showed her kindness? Would Mameha and Mother or the countless men that she entertained have been so kind, or patient, or generous with our flawed character, without her stunning, one-of-a-kind gaze? 

Also, I had a myriad of mixed emotions when I learned that the chairman had a wife. I mean, come on. You've been obsessing over this dude for over a decade, and he has a wife?! And children?! It just really took some of the wind out of the sails in the whole love story if I'm being honest. But I also found it hilarious and, in a way, perfectly fitting. At one point in the story, Mameha tells Sayuri that women become geisha not because they want to, but because they have no other option. I think this unexpected romantic twist really fits in perfectly with these themes of acceptance and managing expectations that we have going on here. 

Again, I just loved this book. Please feel free to share any of your thoughts with me, as well as recommendations for similar books for my next read. Thank you!

books,We're in October so let's talk about Frankenstein,"First off, I want to say it's so impressive that Mary Shelley, a young girl of 18 or 19 wrote a book this good, with so many layers to it ripe for analysis and interpretation. Show a level of intelligence, skill, and maturity that much older people often lack.

Second, before reading the book, I thought Frankenstein was the name of the monster. Then I read the book and realized Frankenstein was the name...of the monster. :p

Seriously though, I both sympathize with and dislike Frankenstein. Sometimes he is like that innocent and highly intelligent and curious kid doing things he does not realize will have severe consequences. Like scientists who did the basic research that was used as the foundation for creating the atomic bomb. At other times he seems to be so full of himself, like an egotistical, moody, and irresponsible parent. Or, well, a merciless God.

One last observation: I very much appreciated Shelley allowing the creature to tell his own story, something that I feel was not often the case for people back in the 1700s and 1800s, especially for women and children.

Essentially what I read was pretty much Hannibal Lecter's origin story. A story that begins on the Eastern Front during the second world war that provided the main ingredients to create the monster that he would eventually become.

Orphaned and brilliant, but with demons that are hiding inside of his memories, gouging him with the fragments of his horrible past. And if he can find and confront them in his heart and brain, he can find them in the flesh and then hunt them down to achieve a kind of peace.

While on the other hand a beautiful exotic woman takes him into her heart, and she uses every weapon and wile she has at her disposal in order to save him from the darkness, and to keep the horrible forces stemmed that were unleashed by Hannibal.

Some of Hannibal's past life was hinted at in the third book, but here in the fourth, and final, book in the series we get the full story. It is in ""Hannibal Rising"" we have a complete picture of how Lecter ended up being the way he is. Along with all the horror and intrigue there is also this very strong sense of tragedy that goes along with it, especially in some scenes.

In my mind this, and also including ""Hannibal"", is pretty solid book. It isn't in the same level of greatness as ""Red Dragon"" or ""Lamb"", but still very solid.

books,Richard Power's The Playground,"I am curious what people's thoughts were about the book.

Personally, I was expecting to like this a lot more. I am an avid scuba diver so I was super excited to see Powers give the ocean the same mystical awe he gave forests in Overstory. I also recognized some of the Polynesian stories having grown up in Hawaii, and was excited to hear about Ina’s life.

Ultimately, the descriptions of the ocean somewhat fell flat. One of my earliest dive memories was seeing a cuttlefish and although the performance Powers described was on paper everything I experienced and more, it still felt it somehow didn’t do it justice. I did read that Powers dove when he grew up, but the book didn't read as if it was written by someone who loved diving.

Here are some of my additional thoughts: 

I also wished we could see more of the relationships between the characters&gt;!, especially Ina and Rafi. I felt we mostly got to know them through Todd's story, but Todd is likely the most unreliable narrator in the book. I wanted to see why they fell in love with each other, hear their side of the (seemly quite significant) relationship they each had Todd, and then also know how the conflict unfolded in their eyes. Given that Ina gets all the money in the end, getting to know a bit more about what drives her would have made the ending feel more closed. I also wish we could have seen a bit into Evelyn's life after Limpet died since that seemed like a very transformational moment for her.!&lt;

I am also curious what people thought of the end. &gt;!It felt a bit like whiplash going from Todd having heard that Rafi was dead to him being on Maketea. Does this mean he really didn't sponsor the project because he had any feelings left about Rafi and his friendship?  Everything at the end with Maketea feels almost like a fantasy where everyone wins. In some ways it felt almost too neat after all the conflict that Todd just finished telling us about. However, maybe this just says more about me and my cynicism to be skeptical of a happy ending.!&lt;

Still though, Thank you James SA Corey for such a wonderful adventure ",Sonawayne,1g0332p,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g0332p/the_ending_of_the_expanse_felt_like_someone_gave/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1g0332p/the_ending_of_the_expanse_felt_like_someone_gave/,2024-10-09 21:46:22,38,0.68,38,0,44,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1g0332p
books,Has anyone here read Playground by Richard Powers yet?,"It's been about two weeks now since ""Playground"" by Richard Powers was released. I just finished it today and was hoping to discuss it here.

I really enjoyed The Overstory even though the back half lost me a bit with the crime plot. I haven't read Bewilderment as I just finished The Overstory about a month ago, but it seems like maybe I haven't missed much there anyway.

Overall I enjoyed Playground but it felt derivative of The Overstory. The couple growing old together with a complicated relationship, the tech guy building an app that mirrors real life, the overarching theme of thoughtfulness about the environment. 

The first half or so was pretty slow. I wasn't particularly invested in Keane and Rafi's friendship. I also felt like Rafi (a black man) was written poorly, almost like a caricature. 

But then the last few pages hit and it all tied together, and I might need a re-read, because I think it changes the perspective of everything in the book. I think it also (maybe) excuses Powers writing the caricature, because it's not really ""him"" writing as an author but Keane's recollection and education of the AI.

books,Is Mr Darcy just the fantasy of the emotionally unavailable man?,"I am definitely new to this subject so very curious what the general assessment is on this. 

But Darcy, to me in my late 30s, comes across as a man who is “emotionally unavailable” and whose sudden interest becomes overwhelmingly flattering because he seems so hard to get. Then the emotions run high with constant conflict during courtship stirring up a lot of sexual tension. So that by the time they actually come together there’s a lot of emotional attachment but based more on drama than actual compatibility. 

The story ends there with a happily ever after, and I won’t say he and Elizabeth aren’t compatible but I do wonder if once the excitement cools, his more unpleasant qualities turn towards Elizabeth. She’s free and outspoken and he is more reserved and controlled. I could see him being a controlling partner or at least a major stuck in the mud. 

That said, Elizabeth’s options of men seem to be timelessly relatable: the good guy who’s not an option, the weird jerk, the nice guy who’s actually a jerk, and the jerk with the golden heart. 

Is Darcy’s golden heart just a hopeful projection that fades after the chase?

UPDATE: first of all, I just watched the Matthew McFadyen movie and can see why so many people have the perspectives they do about Darcy. 

I really love this conversation and am excited to finally be initiated into the lore. 

Based on just the book I do still feel like this is optimistic “diamond in the rough” fantasy like any early Disney fairytale. And I love these fantasies. But I think this book really nails the female perspective. 

Elizabeth seems to change her perspective upon learning more about Darcy. But Darcy’s perceived changes seem directed by selfish interests. His treatment of Elizabeth and his meddling in his friend’s relationship only changes when he takes a personal interest in Elizabeth, however earnest that may be. Alas, in the book, he’s the real deal and truly seems to grow. But my point is that in reality I think these scenarios end up painful and disappointing for the “Elizabeth”. The fantasy is what makes this so enchanting for me though.

books,I finished Shuggie Bain and I have many things to say ,"I picked up this book in mid-September and from the very first pages, I could understand that it would not be a pleasant journey. I decided to read this book slowly and take breaks in-between in order to savour it and recover a little once I felt it got too overwhelming. Even when I didn't read it, the book couldn't leave my mind. I found myself worrying over the characters, trying to guess what would happen next.

I admit that it took me a while to _fully_ get into the story. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the book but it was kinda hard to dive deep into it at the beginning. There were moments which made me kinda bored and there were some parts which dragged and perhaps could have been excluded from the story. Nevertheless, once I dived head first into the book, I was able to appreciate it more. 

The writing was truly exceptional. It's almost hard to comprehend that this was the debut novel of Douglas Stuart. The writing style was mature, descriptive and raw. It did a wonderful job at portraying the characters and it highlighted the bleak atmosphere that surrounded the book. The rich descriptions of the buildings, the people, the working class and the sceneries gave me a better idea of what it would be like to live in '80s Glasgow's tenements and it was clear that the author was familiar with the hardships of poverty and Scottish society during these times. I also appreciated the depiction of the Scottish accent, it was really fun to read it aloud and it made the story more realistic.

The way Stuart wrote the characters is just great. They were flawed and far from perfect and they felt real. I felt many emotions towards them. But my heart aches for Agnes and Shuggie. I was desperate for them to finally find happiness. Although I was sometimes baffled with Agnes' actions, I couldn't blame her entirely. I don't know what it is like to live with an alcoholic and I hope I won't. Agnes was a woman which had to deal with her own demons. She made mistakes and she was trying to fight against her addiction. I found her to be a very complex character. On the one hand, I knowledged that she was not a saint and that she was partly at fault for how her life turned into. On the other hand...I felt sad. Sad for her because she was trying so hard to please a man who didn't truly love her. Sad because she was desperate to find her own happiness. Sad because although she clearly loved her children, she couldn't be a better mother because of alcoholism. Agnes was a flawed human being and even though, I understand why many readers disliked her, I really wished for her misery to end. 

At first, I found it odd that the book focused a lot on Agnes. I had expected that the novel would centre around Shuggie. But the more I think about it, the more I realise that by showcasing Agnes' battle with alcohol, we get to see how her actions affected those around her and how difficult Shuggie's task was. I think that it was important to witness Agnes' life and see how that affected Shuggie and the rest of the family. 

Out of all the characters, the one I loved the most was none other than the boy whose name is prefixed to the cover of the novel. Shuggie had a rough upbringing and ever since he was a small child, he had to endure his mother's fits and the bullying from the other kids. He became more mature and despite the misery around him, he somehow managed to remain optimistic. His love towarrds Agnes is beautiful and tragic. I personally couldn't believe how it was possible for him to live her so much, even though she was in such a bad state. He refused to abandon her, he didn't want to see her getting mistreated and until the very last moment, he just wished she could get back on her feet. Those around him warned him about her, they told him that she was a lost case. And yet he remained by her side, clinging to her and trying his best to help her. On top of that, he had to deal with his inner conflict about his sexuality while trying to fit in a society that constantly belittled him and his mother. His desperation to be considered ""normal"" was heartbreaking to say the least. It's such a bad feeling to feel unwelcome and to feel like you are wrong. I really wanted to hug him and reassure him that he's not wrong and that he's doing his best. 

One of my most favourite experts in the book is the part when Agnes encourages Shuggie to continue his dance, even though their neighbors, the McAvennies were watching and mocking him.  

&gt;“If I were you, I would keep dancing.”
“I can't”. His hands and fingers were still outstretched and frozen, like a dead tree. 
“Don't give them the satisfaction. ”

This right here is one of the best scenes between Snuggie and Agnes. Agnes encourage Shuggie to do what he likes instead of worrying about the McAvennies and she showed him that he should feel comfortable expressing his freedom however he liked. She didn't feel ashamed by him and instead of making him hide his talent in dancing, she wanted to make him be free and not care about the other's opinion. 

The love between a mother and her children is explored well in the book. Although Agnes is not tender with her children, they still cared about her. Catherine and Leek still loved her but they weren't willing to deal with her if that meant that they would be prevented from chasing their own dreams. They wanted to escape from this void which makes total sense. Still, they cared about her. Shuggie and Leek who stayed with her for a longer time made sure to protect her as much as they could. They tried to prevent her from hurting herself or drink too much. Shuggie wanted to make her feel happy so when he saw that Agnes seemed happier around Eugene, he was bitter. Because as her son and as someone who cared deeply about her, he wanted to be _the one_ to make her laugh. He wanted to make her feel good. His love for his mother made him have more tolerance against her outbursts and condition and he tried to remain optimistic for the most part. He was just a kid who wanted the best for his mom. Even if that meant that he would have to sacrifice a part of himself in order to take care of her. 

So far in my life, I have never had any experience with addictions. None of my relatives have been alcoholics so I have no experience in this field. However, I could easily tell that Stuart's depiction of alcohol addiction came from the heart and that he _knew_ what it feels like to be with an alcoholic. Agnes' addiction to alcohol was portrayed in a raw, gut-wrenching way. It made me feel sad, angry, confused...Dealing with an addiction it's by no means pleasant. And it's not easy to recover either. Your actions affect those around you, you slowly destroy yourself and you find yourself trapped in a loop with no way to escape. When Agnes was one year sober, I truly felt salvation. I felt hopeful and I was optimistic that things would change for the best. But they didn't. And when Eugene pressured her to drink again, I was DEVASTATED. I almost screamed and cried from frustration. I considered throwing the book away. And as her addiction continued, I couldn't help but ask: when is this going to end? 

The ending was very beautiful in my opinion. One of the best endings I have read so far. I was sobbing for almost have an hour and my mom had to bring me tissues to wipe my tears. It's bittersweet yet realistic. Agnes' death broke me, especially when I read Shuggie's reaction. But at the same time, I knowledged that Shuggie couldn't do anything more. That was beyond his powers. He did what he had to do but his role as his mother's protector had come to an end. It was time to seize his own day and live his life. It's not easy. And he already has to deal with some problems. But there is still hope. There is hope for a brighter future, one when he will truly be free. 

&gt;“There is no way Shuggie Bain can dance!”
Shuggie tutted. He wrenched himself from her side and ran a few paces ahead. He nodded, all gallus, and spun, just the once, on his polished shoes.

This quote right here makes me tear up everytine I think about it. For the first time, Shuggie is truly free. Free to dance publicly. Free to express himself. Free to become what he wants to. He finally feels comfortable with himself and he is not going to hide anymore. He will continue to ""dance"" and live his life in the best way possible. And that is an encouraging thought. 

As much as I LOVED, LOVED the book, I admit that there were certain aspects which I didn't like that much. As I mentioned above, some parts of the story could have been exluded, I definitely think that had the book been a little bit shorter, it would be slightly better. I also think that as much as I read liked reading about the characters, I feel like there was room for more development. It would be nice if Stuart had dived deeper into their personalities because there were ttimes when I felt like there was more beneath the surface. I understand why some people described them as ""two dimensional"" and I myself would have enjoyed something deeper. 

All in all, this is definitely a book that captured my heart. It's a book that deals with many difficult themes and made me feel many emotions. I don't think that I'll reread it anytime soon but I'll still be haunted by it for a really long time. I am looking forward for the tv series, I really hope we'll get more news about it eventually. If you're planning to read this book, do it. But check the trigger warnings first!

books,Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua was one of my more disappointing reads of the year.,"Wow, this book made me angry. It also made me really sad, and also even more conflicted about my own experience being raised in an Asian family. 

For those not in the know, this is a book by corporate lawyer and writer Amy Chua about her experience raising her two daughters in the ""traditional"" Chinese style - with academic and musical success, obedience, drive, and SUCCESS (oh, did I say that already?) being valued over all else. It's basically a memoir-style work detailing the most extreme form of ""tiger parenting.""

I read it out of curiosity (and to admit, maybe to see if I could find some of my own mother's voice in Chua's book?) and ended up with more than a few gripes. 

* First, the book was published at the wrong time. I think it could have been a lot more insightful if it was published after her children actually grew into adults. The so-called conclusion of the book includes her still-teenager daughters assuring her that they appreciated the way they were raised, and considered it a net positive. I don't know about you, but to me age 14 doesn't seem like the ideal time to get this opinion. It being published later would also give Chua more years to think and maybe make it possible for her to have one single self-reflective point throughout the entirety of the book.
* That sort of brings me into point 2. What is Chua even trying to say with this book? It kind of just seems provocative for the sake of provocation. Okay, you had your child practice for ten hours a day for ten years. You screamed, smashed glasses, never let your child pick extracurricular activities or have friends - at some point it just becomes *we get it.* What did you *learn?* What did you conclude about parenting? Do you think you did the right thing? It was a lot more ""here are some anecdotes about my children! I yelled a lot"" rather than the reflective POV I was expecting. I feel like Chua knew her book would be shocking to a Western audience and just leaned into that rather than make any effort to make her book meaningful.
* Finally, I feel like the most important thing to recognize about this book is that we're hearing about Amy Chua's parenting ""success"" because ultimately, her kids were able to survive it. Something I think not a lot of people want to acknowledge is that children actually are different - not in the ""everybody's special"" kind of way, but more matter-of-factly - some children are less able to handle pressure than others. Some are less intelligent, less driven, more prone to distraction. Some children are Yoon-seoks. (There is an anecdote in the book in which Chua's older daughter, Sophia, comes in second to a boy named Yoon-seok on a multiplication test. In response, Chua has Sophia drill multiplication for hours and hours until she comes in first every time for the rest of the year.) But what if Yoon-seok's parents were jut as invested in success as Chua? But no matter how much they drilled him, he just couldn't beat that other girl in his math class? What happens when it's not a math test, but he just can't beat her out for valedictorian, or that Harvard spot, or that job offer? According to Chua's parenting style, he'll be ""motivated"" by being called garbage every time. Maybe he turns out fine - just second place. Or maybe he becomes a maladjusted adult with anger issues, develops a drinking problem, enters a string of abusive relationships, engages in some combination of these, or just kills himself. And his story will never be told - it'll be ""shameful"" and hidden forever.

But there were some interesting questions I thought this book raised too. Is parenting simpler than Chua's making it? Can you leave your children to make decisions for themselves, just support them, and have them turn out fine? Or is it actually *more* complex than she says, and there's some kind of magical balance that needs to be struck? And what should we tolerate within the Asian community? How much of what Westerners consider ""abuse"" should we accept as part of our culture? None of it? Part of it? What parts? Why do Westerners get to define ""default"" parenting and Asian parenting is the deviation?

I'm still in high school, and have next to no experience when it comes to child-rearing, so I don't expect to get answers to these anytime soon, but I do wonder about it - especially when I catch myself thinking  about how to make sure my children will be in the highest reading group at school without also having them tearing up in the school bathroom over an ""In progress"" grade. I thought Chua might come up with something in over 200 pages, but she seemed more occupied with recitals &amp; shock value.",Honeydew1564,1fzj0pi,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fzj0pi/battle_hymn_of_the_tiger_mother_by_amy_chua_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fzj0pi/battle_hymn_of_the_tiger_mother_by_amy_chua_was/,2024-10-09 04:07:21,470,0.94,470,0,172,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1fzj0pi

But back in 1998, most of us that young (8-12ish) reading books that big would have had no problem with the word ""Philosopher."" And it wasn't as if ""sorcerer"" was really a big part of our standard lexicon either. 

So was it really the reason? If so, it seems like that they didn't really know their target audience. But that doesn't surprise me since most people (especially in the (US) don't give kids enough credit.

books,Count Belisarius near unreadable,"I bought a historical fiction book Count Belisarius (2022 edition) by Robert Graves from a publisher called Seven Stories Press. The original book was published in the 1930's, and Graves isn't an unknown author; he also wrote the relatively well known and received I, Claudius. The editing in this printing is abysmal; like an error a page for at least 50 pages (I stopped reading after 50 pages). I'm not an especially strong editor and haven't taken a lit/eng course in about 10 years, but boy howdy look at how these errors stand out:

Pg. 3 ex, ""... he should never tum is head..."" instead of turn. I think the publisher scanned a faded 1930's printing and had chatgpt or something recreate the scan in a word processor. AI must have read 'rn' as 'm' (I speculate)



Page 4 ex, ""Whether or not he w true to the oath..."" W instead of were.



Page 7 ex, ""... and thus making the Cyclops drunk, thrust out his one eye with the Barning point."" Barning instead of burning. Barning unnecessarily capitalized. 



Page 14 ex, ""...brandishing the red hot spit which Belisarius. had put to heat in the hearth."" One of many times there is punctuation randomly inserted into sentences.



Page 15 ex, ""... The prophet Balaam was not greatly astonished when his as suddenly spoke in God's name."" As instead of ass.



Page 15 ex, ""I was with the remounts in the Persian wan..."" Wan instead of war.



Page 22 ex, ""The affair ended xµore..."" Random use of Greek µ. Also an x thrown in there. Should say more.



Page 23 ex, ""It was there th.at..."" this error occurs twice on this page, both times with the word that.



Page 25 ex, ""convinced Christian a d somewhat scandalized..."" and missing an ""n."" Still has the spacing between a and d though.



Page 26 ex, ""water dock, of which he is so proud and which keeps such poOI; time,"" dock instead of clock, poOI instead of poor. Random ; inserted. Again, somehow two letters, 'c' and 'l' combined to form a 'd.' Why...?



Page 35 ex, ""(This was the other Thracian, a land owner}"" Brackets don't match. Happens more than once.



Page 43 ex, ""the stone by which the tome was dosed..."" dosed instead of closed. 



Page 43 ex, ""a great number oi: rich...'' oi should be of; weird insertion of colon



Page 43 ex, ""New Years Da'y..."" You understand



Page 43 ex, ""walls, floor, and roo£..."" That is a pound Sterling in place of an 'f'.

  
This isn't an exhaustive list of errors; I just picked out some of my favorite examples to keep the list short but demonstrative of different types of errors. I've contacted Seven Stories Press 3 times with no response back, so I guess I'm just stuck with a bricked book. Anyone experience anything similar with publishers? Is there anything I can do?

books,How do you guys remember the plot of all the books you've read? ,"I read a decent amount of books (anywhere between 25–60) every year. Unfortunately, I find that I can barely remember the plot of most of the books, except for the central overarching theme, even as less as 6 months later. 

I've tried the usual methods, such as annotating and active reading, as well as writing goodreads reviews for each. But they don't seem to work too well. 

I understand that there are biological determinants and cognitive differences that affect each person's recall abilities, but if you guys have any tips to remember what you read, please do share!

books,I totally missed the point of this book and now I'm sad. The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers,"EDIT: Someone mentioned this and I couldn't agree more! My problem wasnt the book so much as it was the advertisement. The marketing was waaaay off for this book. For context, this book was suggested after Red Rising....if you've read Red Rising, you would understand how I was totally caught off guard by this book. 

First, Im aware this will come out kinda harsh but I am just really disappointed by how this turned out. Becky Chambers is an awesome writer that I would have loved to love

I am a sucker for a good space epic so when I found The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet, I thought it checked all the boxes. Space colonies, war, illegal arms dealing, lust for power, adventure through the dangers of uncharted space. The characters were complex and likeable sure, but it was the world building that sold me. It was so interesting how each alien species had their own cultures, languages, biases, and social status and how it shaped the formation of this interplanetary government. So when another violent alien race comes into the picture that no one really knows about, its the perfect set up for a killer series.

I was so excited for this story to start until it just...didn't. I was expecting a fast paced, action packed rollercoaster, but instead it felt like 330 pages of opening credits. Instead of diving into this amazing story line, we get three different love stories (more like 2 love stories and 1 oddly placed and unecessary lesbian alien sex scene just because). We get a story of friendship and learning to live with others and random side characters with no other purpose than to cause nostalgia and fill up space on the page and so on and on and on....

All of this squishy slice of life writing wouldn't be an issue by itself, her writing style is very well done. The issue I have is when this soft (and kinda boring) day to day life idea is sitting ontop of an absolute SIFI goldmine in world building. And I thought, ""okay, maaaybe book 1 was just character building for the story progression in book 2."" NOPE, all of the books following never fully circle back around to the crew or the plot of book 1, leaving plenty of questions and confusion as to why it was ever created in the first place. Such a terrible waste of a wonderful thing.

Did anyone else feel this way too? Did anyone like the idea of focusing on the characters in the midst of the chaos instead of the chaos itself?

books,Sex-positive nonfiction books for people who want to explore this topic,"Many of the books my friends and I are reading fall fall under the ‘sex-positive’ umbrella. With that being said, it’s such a broad term. 

What does sex positivity mean to you? 

These are five recommendations from us that cover the wanting, wistful and the wonderful - everything from ethics and politics of sex through to relationships in the modern age, intimacy and desire. 

Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again by Katherine Angel   
Focussing on women, specifically in the age of consent, and a huge uprising of violence against women and girls, Katherine Angel urges that we remake our thinking about sex, pleasure, and autonomy without any illusions about perfect self-knowledge. How can women, in this environment, possibly know what they want? And why do we expect them to? Answers on a postcard. 

Don't Hold My Head Down by Lucy-Anne Holmes  
Written by Lucy when she couldn’t find the book she wanted to read, Lucy explores the world of sex and realises everything is geared to male pleasure rather than to women's. But Lucy didn’t let that stop her - in search of “some brilliant fucking”, Lucy penned a list. “Less bucket, more fuck it”, she notes as she set out to find out what her sex life was missing.   
  
Want by Gillian Anderson  
Gillian Anderson (Sex Education, The X Files, etc.) has compiled a compendium of anonymous sexual fantasies of women from around the world - and included her own anonymous submission. These secret stories are full of desire, fear, intimacy, shame, satisfaction and, ultimately, liberation.   
If you’re looking to revel in someone else’s fantasies, or even reconcile some of your own then these fantasies provide a window into the most secret part of our minds - and Gillian’s inviting you in.  
  
Mating in Captivity, Esther Perel  
In this book, Esther asks the hard questions - does intimacy always equal hot sex, and can we crave what we already have? Analysing sex in committed couples, Ester is determined to reconcile the erotic and the domestic and explains why democracy is a passion killer in the bedroom. She argues for playfulness, distance, and uncertainty. And shows what it takes to bring lust home. 

Rough by Rachel Thompson   
To give it its full title, Rough is about how violence crept into the bedroom, and what we can do about it. Through powerful testimony from 50 women and non-binary people, this book shines a light on the sexual violence that takes place in our bedrooms and beyond, sometimes at the hands of people we know, trust, or even love. Rachel Thompson notes that it's time for a societal shift. “As individuals with agency within our sexual culture we have the power to remodel our behaviour and this book shows us how.”",TandemBookDoctor,1fyg85c,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fyg85c/sexpositive_nonfiction_books_for_people_who_want/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1fyg85c/sexpositive_nonfiction_books_for_people_who_want/,2024-10-07 19:26:14,0,0.33,0,0,20,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1fyg85c
books,Autumn by Ali Smith... Maybe not for me,"Hi. I've just read this book and I don't love it (to put it politely), but probably it was my fault, and that's what I want to ask you. I read the book, connect with the characters in a few chapters, but I miss some conflict in the story. For me, without conflict you don't have a story. I was waiting for a problem to be solve, but then I realized, at page 200, that it will not be any. Probably is my fault, because I used to read books with ""the hero's journey"" structure: hero -&gt; conflict -&gt; resolution (to put in three words), but here I don't have that.  
So, What are your impressions about the book? Is it only the story of a relation? Why do you like it?

I just thought the book revolved around the Count meeting a bunch of strangers in a hotel…that’s it. Ending seemed rather predictable too. 

I had some support here for not enjoying All The Light We Cannot See, which also got very high praise. But I’m not so sure I’ll get the same support since I see nothing but amazing things about AGIM. It’s been hit or miss recently with historical fiction. On to the next one I suppose!
