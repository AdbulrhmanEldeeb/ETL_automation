Pretty great performance relative to how little screentime he has. He plays an incredibly sleazy, misogynistic, douchey tv show executive. However, I like the less crazy things about him that add to what a creep he is. The way he eats the shrimp was pretty gross, which is impressive in a movie that’s full of so many disgusting moments.

movies,Saw Moonraker last night first time and in a theater. What a ridiculous fun movie. Anyone else a fan?,"Saw it last night at  midnight screening in a really great palace theater in LA called the Vista owned by Tarantino so it was an original 35mm print. He only screens movies on film. A bit faded and a few cuts but I love that stuff. 

A few things I know of the Roger Moore bond movies is that they were a little sillier and they had the best songs... and I tend to like them a lot.  

* Moonraker was the only one I never saw and wow it's so crazy like one silly crazy set piece after another with nothing much in between. 
* The jaws guy was hilarious. 
* Bond hits on women so fast in this one it's a little odd even for him.
* Holly Goodhead... great name.
* The space station stuff so great with the laser blasts totally going for a star wars thing. 
* The villain keeps trying to kill bond in the most ridiculous elaborate ways instead of just shooting him in the head. 
* Feels like Austin Powers got a ton of their gags from this movie.

Loved it.  Though I suspect people who like a more serious bond are not fans?

Elisha Cuthbert absolutely shines in this role. Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she’s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. 

Timothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.

Also have to call out Elis best friend ""Matthew""... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next"" at the end

the movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.

movies,cujo from cujo is a tragic villain.,"in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.

for starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.

things get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. ""it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.""

there's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!

even though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",herequeerandgreat,1h3ltsb,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3ltsb/cujo_from_cujo_is_a_tragic_villain/,2024-11-30 20:40:45,36,0.73,36,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h3ltsb
movies,movies of 2025 that you may not be aware are being made,"night of the zoopocalypse

clive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.

grendel

john gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.

high and low

when it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.

the long walk

in addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.

the lost bus

""A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history."" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. 

eddington

ari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.

the battle of baktan cross

when it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.

wildwoods

wildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.

All of the family friendly Studio Ghibli films (Ponyo, Totoro, Secret World of Arietty, Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Boy and the Heron, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, etc.).

I believe a more poignant ending would be to have her come in and hug him from behind, and then the movie cuts to credits, except: she has hair.

While he can't play the guitar in the traditional way, Johan has developed his own unique method of making music. For him, it’s not about perfection but about expressing himself and sharing his passion for sound in a way that’s entirely his own.

Johan also has a deep love for speed and the water. Though he needs assistance getting into a boat, once he’s seated, he takes full control. Steering the boat on his own, he experiences the thrill and freedom that come with gliding across the waves.
Beyond his personal hobbies, Johan has used his life experiences to inspire and connect with others. He’s authored several books that offer a glimpse into his world and the challenges he’s faced. Additionally, his online community of over 13,000 followers on Facebook has grown into a platform for encouragement, creativity, and resilience.

Johan’s story is proof that having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t push boundaries, inspire others, and live a life filled with purpose and joy.

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Portugal - and as in the day before, I really have to say a big thank you to all the participants: We got more than 60 comments and almost as many movie suggestions. I'm also looking forward to another movie on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Capitão Falcão*** (engl.: *The Portuguese Falcon*) even have a fitting title in the english distribution. Never heard about it, but it seems to be a funny movie that also shows a little of the Portuguese culture.

Today, we skip Q in alphabetical order (no country starting with Q in Europe) and directly go to R... in this case, R like **Romania** for the start. As always, there are only two rules in the game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

This month we look at a relatively forgotten 50s musical called Gigi, the first film won by long-time nominee Vincente Minnelli. It also serves as the great comeback of rom-com legend Maurice Chevalier and is often considered the last of the great MGM musicals.

In part 2, we look at somewhat more famous films such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the great religious epic The Seventh Seal, the 50s drive-in classic The Blob, a truly great Dracula adaptation and what is often considered Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.

I am a divorced man in my middle age with a son of seventeen. He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.

With his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. 

He also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and ""some other films that are not as interesting"". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.

And I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.

Or should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later?

movies,"With today’s appetite for legacy sequels and expanded universes, a Seth Gecko film would resonate with both longtime fans and a new generation eager to see Rodriguez revisit his gritty, blood-soaked roots.","It’s a real shame that Robert Rodriguez has mostly shifted to making kid-friendly movies lately. While Spy Kids and We Can Be Heroes are fun in their own way, they don’t really tap into the raw, edgy filmmaking talent that made Rodriguez stand out in the first place. He built his career on gritty, intense films like Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, which pushed boundaries and brought something fresh to action and horror. A movie about Seth Gecko would be the perfect chance for him to return to those roots, creating a film that’s dark, thrilling, and full of that unique Rodriguez style that made his earlier work so unforgettable.

movies,What are your most unpopular hopes/predictions for Bond 26?,"For me, Bond 26 should be less like the Daniel Craig movies (even though I love his take on the character), and more like the Pierce Brosnan ones. Those movies I think found the groove between too serious and too campy. I'd love for the new Bond to be a little more fun. 

I'd also like to see Bond girls that James doesn't actually fall in love with. I didn't have a problem with this or anything in previous films, I just think it's been done to death with OHMSS, the Spy Who Loved Me, Casino Royale, Spectre and No Time to Die. 

Bringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Everyone else can be new, but I would like to keep Bond tradition of keeping the same supporting actors. If I could only keep ONE actor, I'd say Whishaw because I'd love to see him stick around for decades like Desmond Llewyn did.

movies,A Different Take on The Notebook's Ending,"

Hi Everyone, 

I recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:

Instead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.

Years later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.

One day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.

Then, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.

But fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",Chahes03,1h3laak,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h3laak/a_different_take_on_the_notebooks_ending/,2024-11-30 20:16:01,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h3laak
