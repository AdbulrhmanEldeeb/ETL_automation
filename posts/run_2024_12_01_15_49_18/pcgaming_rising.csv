pcgaming,Do you know examples of steam games that are region locked that only exist in certain countries? (As in them not having a worldwide release.),"I know for instance, *The Idolmaster: Starlit Season* &amp; *Dragon Quest X (Offline)* remain region locked (even on steam) to exist within Asia (both East &amp; SEA nations such as *Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam &amp; Singapore.* which for some reason the distributors only aimed for the Asian demographic leaving out as evident with the available languages being Japanese, Chinese &amp; Korean.

Then, how can Western fans of the Dragon Quest series acquire access to [DQ X (Offline)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358750/?snr=1_25_4__318) \[&gt;!This game won't be available if you reside outside Japan or other Asian countries, just keep that in mind.!&lt;\] since Square Enix did not release it worldwide?

pcgaming,"Introducing my chill, story-driven survival-crafting game, AETHUS.","Hey PC gamers!

I wanted to introduce my solo-dev project, a sci-fi survival-crafter/base-builder, [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming).

**[Check out the trailer here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwB0r5f6T80)**

**AETHUS is a story-driven survival game, meaning there's always a narrative-driven reason to go on your next expedition into the underground open world!** 

You'll mine and gather resources in a physics-driven world rendered with Lumen and Nanite in UE5, while building up your mining outpost on the surface with easy to use yet extremely powerful building and decoration tools.

I've spent a lot of time making these tools as simple to use as possible and the whole game is **packed with quality-of-life features** like building/crafting/cooking from storage automatically, the ability to disable collisions when building so you can position things JUST right, and much more.

I left my AAA job after 7 years in the industry back in 2023 to go indie on my own and make this game, with **no AAA bullshit** - no AI, no microtransactions or cosmetics, no predatory development, no releasing a half-done bug-filled product in Early Access, just good old-fashioned gamedev.

[I'd love to get your thoughts on the game, so there's a demo you can try out right now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming)

A [Wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redpcgaming) would be super appreciated if you like the look of the game, single every one helps a solo indie dev like me!
