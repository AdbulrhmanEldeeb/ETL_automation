gaming,Buying games on PS5 Pro vs Series X?,"So, one of the main difference of this generation (PS5 Pro apart) was the PS5 controller, and a few games use the specificities of its controller.

A couple of Qs from that:
- Which games use the dual sense feature?
- Do you know any reviewer at least touching on that? Nowadays it’s never really mentioned when a game is available on both platforms for there’s anything specific for the PS controller
- For those of you having the luxury to have both consoles, where do you decide where to buy your games? I’m looking at The Plucky Squire for example, I want to buy it but no idea of the PS5 dualsense adds something to the experience or not, it’s kind of weird really developers don’t really take the time to mention it. Given Xbox tends to be better with back compat and allows for Play Anywhere (thus PC or handheld) it seems safer to buy on that platform, unless I’m missing something.

gaming,Horses no longer gallop in Red Dead Redemption 2,"
Just as the title says, my horses will no longer gallop or even stride at a decent pace.  My horses only trot at the slowest speed, just happened out of nowhere today while playing on my Xbox Series X.  Even horses I steal from NPCs will stop and just walk.  I only just got the game a couple weeks ago, too.  I have tried every possible solution I could come across:

* I fed the horse
* groomed it over and over
* patted the horse
* removed the saddle and put it back on
* rode without a saddle
* switched to different horses at stables
* reloaded the most previous save
* reloaded old saves
* changed controllers
* closed the game and removed it from Quick Resume, waited a minute to relaunch
* did a hard restart on the XSX console
* I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it

All those things and my horse(s) will not move any faster than a walking stride.  This has affected every single horse across all my saves.  I have already put plenty of progress into the game, but now I either have to go without a horse or play at a snail’s pace

A few years ago they showcased some development footage and holy shit that looked awesome! I always loved BGE's multicultural but mostly Indian themed architecture combined with sci-fi.
