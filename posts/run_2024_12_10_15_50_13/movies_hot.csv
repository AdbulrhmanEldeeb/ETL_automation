movies,Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?,"Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, and soon probably Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?

First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.

Another example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo.",RockyPS2Glitches,1hauuix,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hauuix/actorsactresses_who_screwed_up_a_comeback_arc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hauuix/actorsactresses_who_screwed_up_a_comeback_arc/,2024-12-10 05:39:13,375,0.89,375,0,301,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hauuix

&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/) (60):

&gt;For those who can’t get enough of Middle Earth, here’s two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm’s Deep (where we saw Saruman’s Orcs obliterated by Ents in “The Two Towers”).

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (80):

&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore’s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).

[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien’s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm’s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we’ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):

&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie’s greatest strength — The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson’s LotR in the best way. It’s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):

&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from ""The War of the Rohirrim."" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that’s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It’s hard to get mad at this movie, but it’s oh so easy to be disappointed.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):

&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson’s trilogy — few do — but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):

&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth’s famous legends.

\--------

Directed by Kenji Kamiyama

&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.

movies,I have a question about “The substance” I seriously don’t this one thing. ,"If you haven’t noticed - spoiler ahead .

So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise “you are one” with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth’s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. 

But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it’s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn’t? But the bigger question is if you are Elisabeth, you don’t actually get to experience being young again, you go to sleep for a week wasting away, why would anyone want to just clone themselves and keep going when they don’t get anything out of it?! It just doesn’t make sense. Is there a reasonable explanation within this movie’s universe that I’m just not getting ?

movies,La La Land’s (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009),"I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb’s club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.

Despite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would’ve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would’ve played out in other circumstances, I can’t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could’ve been, and ill-fated love. 

The way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It’s hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. 

I know it’s strange to compare La La Land to an animated children’s movie, but I couldn’t help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they’re able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. 

Barring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up? Any thoughts about La La Land and its ending?

movies,Hellboy: The Crooked Man is better than I expected,"I'm a fan of Brian Taylor and I love the Hellboy character, but I expected this to be a complete disaster after it got buried during its release. Honestly, it isn't a great movie, but it's completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it's pretty clear that most of what we're seeing is fake, which drags it down. 

Despite me finding it passable enough, I'm really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn't much of a box office draw either, which is a shame as the comics are excellent.

Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8

Thanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.

Without any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).

Through 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.

***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.

***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.

Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.

The Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.

Paramount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.

Sony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.

Fathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country’s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).

Debuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. 

This shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.

According to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful ""C–"" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.

Outside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.

Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.

A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.

Searchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.

While ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.

***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.

***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M

- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Five films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.

The first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.

The other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.

Paramount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.

Amazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.

The other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.

movies,The Nextflix animation The Sea Beast is better than almost every Disney film that's come out in the last 10 years.,"Obviously the heavy hitters, Moana, Frozen, Brave, maybe Encanto, are all very good films, but The Sea Beast is hands down one of the best animations I've seen.

The visual effects are awesome, water hasn't been done better. The characters are well thought out and very entertaining, Karl Urban plays the role of Jacob very well. The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The ""pirate speak"" could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.

It's got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It's got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.

Also, my 3yo boy is obsessed with it, so I'd have to watch it whether I liked it or not.

movies,District 9 is great original film.,"A recommendation post of this film suddenly popped on my Instagram feed and I thought I should give it a try. I'm glad that I did.

I knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it has aliens in it (thought that it was an alien invasion movie).

Never in my life did I imagine that a film can make me sympathize with aliens and hate humans. Everything about this film is perfect. The documentary style narrative worked so well in this movie. Sharlto's character arc is simple yet so effective and beautiful. This is the most realistic film featuring aliens that I have ever watched. It made me believe that something like this can truly happen. To show aliens as refugees instead of invaders somehow felt so realistic and fresh.
 
Another thing that I loved about the film was it's pacing. It's perfectly paced and never drags or dips in quality. The film has a runtime of 1 hr 56 mins but it felt like I finished it in 30 mins.

The ending made me cry which no other film has ever managed to do (grave of the fireflies being an exception).

The only thing that I personally felt was slightly off in this film (it may be a little nit picky) was that it was starting to lose a little bit of its realism, but it gets back to the point eventually.

In short, District 9 is a unique film with great screenplay, Awesome performances (Sharlto especially), Beautiful yet haunting frames and some of the best social commentary I have ever watched in any film.

Highly recommend if you haven't already watched it.",CYBOZAX_,1ha0t0x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha0t0x/district_9_is_great_original_film/,2024-12-09 03:40:06,2228,0.92,2228,0,218,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha0t0x

FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT REMEMBER THE MOVIE OR THE OPERA THEYRE DEPICTING. HELP. I'm mostly confident it isn't Phantom of the Opera (as that'd be too easy). I'm also mostly sure it isn't the recent version of Cyrano...anyway...

movies,"""The Lovely Bones:"" A New Add to My Least Favorite Movies List","I just saw the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" for the first time and fucking despise it. Obviously, I don't think all movies need a happy ending, but it's the way the ending is framed that disgusts me. I interpret the message as basically, don't be so preoccupied with justice; just let nature take its course and let the promise of a peaceful afterlife pacify you. 

I came to this conclusion because the murderer just dies via natural causes instead of going through the justice system, paired with (emphasis on ""paired with"" since I know most murders aren't solved irl) the guide in the afterlife telling the murdered girl ""everyone dies"" to make her less angry about her murder, how negatively the father's search for the killer is portrayed, and the lack of urgency the sister has after she finds evidence of the murder. Absolutely revolting. 

I also don't appreciate the watering down of the rape the book had featured, I mean, it's not even really mentioned in the movie. Just maybe briefly alluded to, with the murderer calling the girl pretty and asking if she had a boyfriend, as well as him only having female victims. And rape sure as hell isn't a minor thing that happens to ""everyone"" like the spirit guide describes death. The complete erasure of the very real reality of sexual violence, its impact on victims, and its connection to femicide disgusts me. Way too sanitized. Idk the point of alluding to rape if they were just going to half-ass it and downplay its emotional signifigance. 

Furthermore, I could almost go as far as to say the ""cool grandma"" character supports this lackadaisical attitude towards pedos with her fondly recalling enjoying her first kiss with a ""grown man"" at the beginning of the movie and her telling the murdered girl's mom to just ""live with it"" less than a year after the murder.

It's crazy to me that I don't see more about how much this movie trivializes violence against women and children.

Finally, and this is a lesser critique, but I don't think the perpetuating of the ""weird looking, creepy stranger"" pedo stereotype is particularly helpful when most victims of pedos are at the hands of people who aren't strangers, and in fact, many are (superfically) charming and attractive.

This movie isn't completely irredeemable, as I do find the build up before the girl is murdered very accurate to experiences I've had with scary men, and I like the scene where she discovers that she's dead, but damn, this shit mostly sucks.

EDIT: I guess I wasn't as articulate as I could have been, no I don't think they needed to show a 14 year old literally getting raped, please stop saying that's what I said or asking why I supposedly wanted to see that. My point there was, I think the film is way too flipant with how it handles rape's emotional impact by not acknowleding what happened in any way, or at the very least by rushing the girl to get over it ASAP. Girls need to show that this isn't okay and their upset feelings are valid when it happens to them. No death survivors can get anything from this movie, as they are dead. However SA survivors can. And if the point wasn't supposed to be about the girl, we didn't need to see her in the afterlife.",Due_Assist_7614,1ha2xe2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha2xe2/the_lovely_bones_a_new_add_to_my_least_favorite/,2024-12-09 05:43:43,537,0.73,537,0,219,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha2xe2

My Top 5 
1. The Menu (2022) might be in my actual top 5 of all time, so funny while still super tense 
2. Coherence(2013) one of the best mind bender movies I’ve seen and made for 50k which still blows my mind
3. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) movie just is stuck inside my soul and is so depressing while being comforting simultaneously 
4. The Thing (1982) unbelievable how good it looks for being over 40 years, perfect paranoia thriller 
5. Frailty (2001) another great mind bender

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Turkey,"Hello there,

since more than 40 days I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Switzerland's turn and it was certainly not the first try to bring the *Three colours*\-trilogy into the game, but now, finally, quasi at the last opportunity, it made the cut: ***Trois couleurs: Rouge*** (engl.: Three colours: Red) will be the next entry on our official letterboxd list. 

What comes next? Well, we'll see - here in this thread. I am following the alphabetical order of the Council of Europe's official list of European countries here, which means, on the one hand, that we're yet to get to England and the like (stay tuned), but on the other hand it also means that today we are  talking about a country that is only partially part of geographical Europe: I'm looking for movies set in **Turkey**. But even in this case, there are only two rules to follow when approaching this country from a cinematic perspective:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

And he says besides the major movies. He loves goofy movie and the second one. And third is how to eat fried worm. He’s seen the sandlot and likes that too same with Holes. 

From what i can tell. He likes the part where its a kids school life and being successful at it. Kinda. He likes the school life style of hanging out. Going on adventures. That sorta thing.

I was very excited to watch Dear Santa because it felt like a wholesome, old school Christmas movie, all I really knew about it was the concept and that one trailer I saw, but that was enough for me.

The movie was just wholesome from beginning to end and at the end, it did it, a story that FINALLY had the courage to and we're heading into end game major spoiler territory here

&gt;!A story that had the courage to DEFY death! THANK YOU to the writers, whoever approved it, thank you!!&lt;

&gt;!I'm so tired of stories teaching us that the dead are gone and we should accept it, that we can't bring our loved ones back and all that reality check stuff. No, this is a fantasy movie, this is a world that someone imagined and in their world this kinda stuff IS possible because the worlds we create in our imagination are ours to write the rules in and the writers did just that. I'm glad that somewhere out there exists a world like this, I wish ours was one but it isn't, but I'm happy just to see this stuff.!&lt;

So not only did I enjoy this heartwarming movie from the very beginning, but it ended the way I was hoping it would ever since I learned of the main plot twist I would say.

this is my #1 new Christmas Movie alongside Klaus.

movies,Han’s Zimmer’s score for Interstellar,"I was fortunate enough to get IMAX 70MM tickets for a showing. Of Interstellar’s re-release last weekend.

Obvious love for the visuals aside. One thing that I did not appreciate when I saw this film 10 years ago was the stakes and what was happening to the characters. Being that this was Nolan’s first original film since Inception, I was focused a lot more on the visual spectacle, along with wondering if I could “solve” his movie like many tried to after Inception released.

I can say after seeing the film this weekend that as incredible as the visuals are, the dialogue and score are even more incredible than I possibly remembered.

I read that Zimmer was challenged by Nolan to pretty much create these original compositions, and this score mixed with the dialogue had me openly bawling like a baby in multiple scenes. “Stay/Coop leaving Murph” in particular had me crying through the whole sequence. 

there is something so powerful in that composition that just had me losing it. It might be the idea that I’m becoming more open to becoming a father, but when the entire orchestral noise starts escalating as Coop is letting Tom have the truck, I am wailing for him to stay. 

And this was just for one of the compositions in this film. I can keep going on about how this element alone was truly amazing for a film like this.

But my god it was incredible. I had heard good things but it still exceeded my expectations. Visuals, fantastic. Story, even better. The pacing was damn near perfect as far as I'm concerned. And considering it was a Godzilla movie I found myself incredibly moved by the characters, none of whom were one-dimensional characatures.

I hate when movies are too optimistic and I thought this walked the line perfectly between tragedy and fortune.

movies,Onegin (1999) - Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler are excellent in this beautiful romantic drama based on the novel in verse by Russian writer Alexander Pushkin.,"https://preview.redd.it/lfizh83n9q5e1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c406dbf791527cd189be56708ea4efc41484aa1d

Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"" is well-known in English-speaking countries, partly due to the influence of Tchaikovsky's opera, so I need not set out the plot in any detail. It centres upon the relationship between Yevgeny Onegin, a 19th century Russian landowner, and a teenaged girl named Tatyana Larinа, the daughter of a neighbour. Tatyana falls passionately in love with Onegin and writes him a letter setting out her feelings, but he replies that he cannot return them. Six years later Onegin meets Tatyana again and discovers that she is now married to a prince. A subplot deals with a duel fought between Onegin and Vladimir Lensky, the fiancé of Tatyana's sister Olga.

Ralph Fiennes executes a stunning performance as the aloof, sarcastic disillusioned aristocrat managing a performance which combines a great deal of emotion and extreme surface passivity; Liv Tyler is at her most beautiful in one of her best performances to date as the poignant Tatiana who, as the film unfolds, evolves from passionate idealism into resignation and honour.

As for the story, the movie is very faithful to the Pushkinian attitude. The story is very character-centred, typical to Russian lit. The change in Evgenyi Onegin  is marked indeed. However, the character of Tatyana captivated me. Her faithfulness to herself and to her integrity is amazing.

movies,"""Hammering the door shut"" in The Hateful Eight is one of my all time favorite bits in any movie. Any other movies with comedic bits as a side story that get more ridiculous as the movies goes on?","Recently watched The Hateful Eight for the 3rd time now and one of my favorite comedic bits of all time is everyone trying to hammer the door shut while getting into Minnie's haberdashery.

It just gets more and more chaotic and silly as the movie goes on. First Kurt Russell's character struggling to keep the door shut while being handcuffed to his prisoner and getting yelled at by random strangers. Then Walton Goggins character goes through the same thing 20 minutes later, the massive struggle of one board not being strong enough to hold, everyone staring at them judging and shouting to really nail it in. OB accidentally hits the wooden board instead of the nail and saying ""jesus christ, that door is a son of a whore"" as the wooden board breaks in two. Then 15 minutes later the mexican character hitting his head against the lamp while trying to nail the door for the third time now and we see how fucked up the door boards are because everybody keeps trying to really nail it in. 

Of course later on we learn why the door was broken in the first place but I really enjoy these small side bits to the main story that makes it feel more authentic.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Switzerland,"Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Sweden. Almost 100 comments later, I think, we've found a very interesting new entry for [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): I mean, I've never seen it, but I will, because (apart from the fact that I will watch every movie on this list), c'mon, if I have been informed correctly, **Det Sjunde Inseglet** (engl.: *The Seventh Seal*) shows us Max von Sydow playing chess with the Death! To be honest, I doubt that the next winner will be able to top that...

...but we can try. I'm following an alphabetical order here (yeah, yeah, I know, that England and Co are still missing, wait for it), and so, we now take a look at movies set in **Switzerland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

All I can figure is that people believe this is Clint Eastwood's last movie and are being nice; nobody wants to send him to the afterlife with a movie that is 25% fresh with an IMDb of 5.4. Or am I offbase here?

The third movie did not leave me with the same sense of joy. I mean, Denzel is always great, but it's quite slow for a third movie in an action series and apart from a few specific scenes it just doesn't have the intensity that I remember from the first two movies.

Some ups and downs:
+Denzel glooming
+Nice to see Dakota Fanning in something again
+Nice location
-Boring villain
-Slow pacing
-Denzel is sitting at a table for 60% of the movie

I came up with a way I think this movie got made: Denzel wanted to go on a vacation to Sicily, and the movie crew asked if they could pay his trip if they got to film him sitting at a few restaurants and do four short action sequences with him.

movies,"Now You See Me 3 (2025) - Cast, Release Date - Parade","Now You See Me 3 wasn't delayed because of COVID like the writer claims. The head of Lionsgate notoriously was more interested in hitting specific release dates than making good movies. Writer/director Gary Ross didn't return to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games because Lionsgate wouldn't give him any time to work on the script or do pre-production prep. The sequel ended up going into production without any script at all --the director was shooting pages from the book until a shooting script was cobbled together. Catching Fire was a big hit anyway because of the goodwill generated by the first film but Lionsgate's slapdash approach to production led to diminishing audience interest and box office for the final installment (which was split into two films since that worked for Harry Potter and Twilight).

Before Now You See Me 2 opened Lionsgate announced that part 3 would be going into immediate production and be released the following year --but audiences weren't happy with the sequel which underperformed in North America. Lionsgate claimed the China box office made up for the disappointing returns in North America which clearly wasn't true because the original sequel which was to be helmed by Jon Chu again was cancelled.

In addition to completely screwing up the sequel to Now You See Me Lionsgate did the same with the sequel to the Bruce Willis action comedy R.E.D. Now You See Me and R.E.D. were both developed by Summit Pictures before that company was acquired by Lionsgate.

She was so excited and hopeful. It was a knife in the chest and the back. I still have never forgiven the actor that was her boss. I'll honestly stop watching something if he pops up.

The performances of everyone in this movie was amazing, but its few films where you feel just as bad emotionally as the character does. You feel bad for them. You feel as if ""what if that happened to me?!"" and you're living it in real time.

Its not so much the actions, because a lot of people go through this. But watching the entire before and after is what the film captured well. It was seeing a characters candle extinguished.

The only other time I really felt the film was when the villagers in Apocalypto were enslaved/sacrificed. It really captured how dire the situation was, and how much of a total and complete alien mindfuck that would have been.

After a while, why would producers and directors still want to pick him up? Especially if his movies haven’t been very successful recently.

Favorite movie: Strange Darling, with Civil War as a runner-up 

Favorite performance: Naomi Scott in Smile 2

movies,I don't agree with the sentiment that the Driver from Drive was a psychopath (SPOILERS),"Just watched the movie for the first time. Fantastic, instantly went to see what others were discussing. Seems the common consensus seems to be the Driver was sociopath/psychopath, even my friends think so.

To me, the movie was a character study on a troubled man looking for a normal, happy life, but got involved with the wrong people (and continues to.) Not a sociopath or psychopath. Probably on the spectrum. The whole movie was also showing us that he was a real human being. 

First, biggest signs of a socio/psychopath are lack of empathy and love, but he clearly has a lot of empathy and love for Irene and the child. He puts himself into danger just so he can keep them from harm. He isn't just physically or intimately in love with her, he never advances on her in a sexual way, it's a sweet and caring love. The elevator scene didn't scream lust to me (or my wife) personally, just a final kiss before he'll never see her again. The dates were always innocent with them chilling with her child. He is also very clearly distraught when Shannon dies, who again, proves to be part of the wrong friends he accidentally associates himself with. 

At the beginning of the movie, he denies a job for a lot of money from a previous client. Tells him to STFU, but ends up inadvertently taking the job because now Irene and her little boy are in danger if he doesn't.

People also mention the brutality of his kills, but all his kills in the movie come from self defense, or defense of a loved one. He was furiously stomping on the guy in the elevator because he was an active and present threat to Irene. It was a violent outburst towards his frustration at being unable to keep a person he loves out of danger. She becomes sad because she realizes she fell in love with yet another man with violent baggage that mean harm to the family.

He 100% does have a violent past. That is why he is disconnected, awkward, calculated and aware. 

He has good intentions, but fate and nature keep him away from them. He's the frog, the scorpion, and the shark in one package. He's not feigning his care for humanity. He sacrificed his only remaining bond to keep her safe. He left the money behind. Gave her a sweet goodbye voicemail. Clearly sad as he drives onto nowhere, where he'll probably get a job on the spot from a random guy again, forever and ever in this cycle.",Forhaver,1ha4h5u,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha4h5u/i_dont_agree_with_the_sentiment_that_the_driver/,2024-12-09 07:28:38,0,0.49,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1ha4h5u

For exemple, Smile 2, Blink twice etc They also don't wear it on the red carpet or premiere.

I wanna add  that I'm a an anti vaxxer or anti mask in any ways. I just got the flu shot and I will wear a mask when I feel sick.

movies,"Gulliver's Travels with Jack Black it doesn't even manage to be a fun parody of Jonathan Swift's book,","Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear.

What is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose. 

the film gives us  two woozy love interests and a multitude of over-the-top jesters (also guised in the form of kings and generals). The overall story has whittled down to the bare minimum of Liliputs and conflicting kingdoms, but apart from the that the connection is non-existent.

movies,What did we think of Nightbitch?,"I was on the fence, leaning negative, for the first two-thirds. This is coming from someone who unreservedly adores *Can You Ever Forgive Me* and *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*. Once it hit the third act, I got it. And thank god it clicked, because it would have made me really sad to give a negative review to a movie that needle-drops ""Dare to Be Stupid"" by Weird Al.

While I still prefer Marielle Heller's previous films, this big and often baffling swing reveals itself as a deeply personal reflection on balancing artistic legacy with continuing heritage. Kudos to Heller for making a film on her terms, even if it almost turned me off completely before eventually winning me over.

I was reminded of Ari Aster's *Beau Is Afraid*. In *Beau*, Joaquin Phoenix as Aster's self-insert protagonist only finds peace when performing a play in the woods—mirroring how Aster himself might only feel at ease when creating films and seeing the world through his unique lens. Even as some audiences follow Richard Kind's character out the door wondering what the hell they just saw, they at least had the opportunity to understand how it feels to live with Aster's restless, haunting brain.

An unhinged Amy Adams gives us a similar peek into Heller's mind in *Nightbitch*. And like Scoot McNairy's character admits, I ""didn't get it"" at first. Honestly, as a single man with no kids, I still don't get all of it. But now I feel a little closer to empathizing, rather than just sympathizing, with moms in the arts.

(Side note: I saw Brian De Palma's *Phantom of the Paradise* a week ago and didn't recognize a young Jessica Harper until the end credits. Then tonight I didn't realize an older Jessica Harper plays Norma until I saw her name on the Letterboxd page. I don't know what's causing my Jessica-Harper-prosopagnosia, but as a big fan of hers, I'm hoping one of the witches at Tanz Akademie can cast a spell to fix it.)

movies,Was the Hag in Snow White an Illusion?,"We all know that after the huntsman fails to provide Snow White's heart, the queen then magically transforms herself into the old hag which she then uses to trick Snow White into eating the apple.

The thing that I've always been curious on is whether or not that transformation is simply an illusion or not. What I mean is does the black magic only make her appear to be an old woman but she still functions as her normal self or is it truly a transformation and she IS that old woman? Sure she acknowledges the voice change, but she also seems to run pretty damn fast for an old woman and almost succeeded in moving a boulder onto the dwarfs; also an impressive feat given her ""age"". It wouldn't surprise me if someone that powerful was able to keep her strength and endurance while changing the voice to make it believable. 

What do you all think? 

Bonus question, do you think that after her death the magic wore off? Or did she remain even in death as the hag?

Regardless, personally she remains tied for my top Disney villain (with Maleficent), and by far the scariest, particularly as a child.

movies,Do Audiences Even Care About Cinematic Details Like Color and Light?,"As a filmmaker passionate about cinematography, I’ve been diving deep into the niche of film emulation—replicating the look and feel of celluloid film in digital work. I find it fascinating, almost magical, how the right colors, textures, and lighting can transform a scene. But here’s the question that keeps circling in my mind: Do audiences, especially those not involved in filmmaking, really see these subtle details? Do they feel them, even if they don’t consciously notice?

For context, I make movies purely for fun, out of passion. They’re not for money or validation, just a way to express myself. Sometimes I wish I could ask my 10-year-old self—someone who simply loved movies without knowing the technical side—if these nuanced elements would have mattered to him. Back then, I wasn’t thinking about grain structure, dynamic range, or color grading. I was just immersed in the magic of storytelling.

It reminds me of this video by Cleo Abram about football shots. She discussed how people thought the footage looked incredible—like it was shot in 8K—when, in reality, it was all about the aperture. The shots people loved were done on DSLRs with a shallow depth of field, unlike traditional broadcast cameras with their massive lenses, which prioritize a different aesthetic. When I saw the footage, I instantly recognized it was the aperture creating that ""cinematic"" look, not resolution or 8K. But it was fascinating to see how much people loved the DSLR footage without knowing why.

From this example, it’s clear that people do notice these things—but does it really matter? My assumption is that there’s a bare minimum that evolves over time as generations grow up exposed to better and better clarity. They notice the overall improvement, but they can’t pinpoint what it is—and honestly, they don’t even care. It’s not their job to know these details.

That’s the thing, right? This is also why smartphones have diminished DSLR sales compared to a few decades ago, when standalone cameras were the only option. Obviously, we in the industry know the technical reasons why DSLRs are still better than even flagship phone cameras. But that’s not the point. The point is the bare minimum.

And honestly, as an aspiring filmmaker, I feel great about this. It means I can start with a smartphone as my camera. All I have to do is figure out what the bare minimum is for how my movies need to look. Everything above that is good to have, but not necessarily a deal-maker.

Because at the end of the day, if the vibe of the movie doesn’t resonate with someone, they won’t want to watch it—no matter how good it looks, even in IMAX.

So, to the community here: Do you think the average viewer, or even a younger version of yourself, notices or appreciates subtleties like film emulation, color, or light? Or are these details more of a filmmaker's obsession? And what do you think that ""bare minimum"" standard is today?

Edit-
The reason why I ask this question is because I make movies simply because the process makes me happy. But sometimes, I find myself diving too deep into the rabbit holes of filmmaking details, losing track of the joy and starting to see perfection in those details as the only path to fulfillment—when it’s really not. That’s not who I am. Even though I make movies for myself, I wanted to understand what the audience actually feels about these things because, honestly, I’ve been exhausted thinking about it all on my own. What I really want is the clarity to know when I’ve done enough, to recognize when I’m focusing too much on the details and losing sight of myself in the process.",No-Indication9775,1ha8nph,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha8nph/do_audiences_even_care_about_cinematic_details/,2024-12-09 12:31:23,0,0.25,0,0,18,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha8nph

movies,Was the main character of Kingdom of Heaven (2005) the real son of Godfrey in the movie? I think he might not have been.,"Rewatching the movie and I start to think that Bailan (Orlando Bloom) may not have been Godfrey's (Liam Neeson) real son.

I see it as Godfrey and his circle were driven by meritocracy and finding a right guy to fit into Jerusaleem to keep peace, justice and all.

After seing the smith and hearing about his talents, the hosptalier (David Thewils) asks Godfrey ""remember what we talked about on the road?"".

I think that they either
a) agreed to come back to France and pick the most deserving/fitting man to become Godfrey's heir, either while on the road or even before sailing out from the Holy Land

b) Met his real son and realized they couldn't let such a jerk inherit the.piece of the kingdom of god they were building

c) Both a) and b) + hearing about his engineering talents played the crucial part of choosing him.

It is just a presumption, but it lays into the narrative which both Godfrey and King of Jerusaleem pronounce, ""everyone can be the master of his fate here, no matter who he was in his homeland"".

Baldwin even straightly says ""a father may claim a son"" while pronouncing this whole narrative during his first conversation with Bailan.",RuslanNCAA,1ha1p10,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ha1p10/was_the_main_character_of_kingdom_of_heaven_2005/,2024-12-09 04:30:26,0,0.33,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1ha1p10
movies,Favorite movie by european country: Sweden,"Hello there!

Yesterday, I've asked you for your favorite movie set in Spain. It's interesting, because more than 100 comments later, in a way, we have a ""fpreign-but-not-so-foreign"" winner here: Internationally, ***El labertino del fauno*** (engl.: *Pan's Labyrinth)* is likely to be the best-known film on our list so far.

But [our official letterboxd list ](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)immediately calls for the next movie. We now move on to the next euorpean country with S, namely **Sweden**. Just like yesterday, there are only two rules to follow today:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

However, in the home she lives in, the male character has a 70s model car, a record player, and is watching a movie in black and white. It makes me think of other movies that have done the same. In iRobot, Will Smith had a retro stereo system that was behind the current tech in the movie. In WALL-E, the robot is always watching vintage black and white movies. In the 2018 movie Upgrade where the main character gets an AI implant to give him the ability to walk again, he also has a 70s model car.

EDIT 2: Disrespect to those multiple Dawn of the Dead fans who are downvoting all my posts. Not sorry for dissing your fave.

I love zombie movies, particularly scary ones. I was six years old when I first watched Zombieland and ever since I've had a lifelong fear and interest in the undead.

My personal favourites are World War Z, The Night Eats the World, and Train to Busan, those are horrific!!

movies,"I'm gonna defend the ""Liar revealed"" trope in Bug's life","I know people hate the ""Liar Revealed"" trope and im not gonna argue that this scene is actually a ""Masterfully done example"" of it or anything, but people always say the same thing regarding it.  ""Why do they care that Flik lied?  They have the giant bird! thats the plan now! why wouldnt that work?!?!""

But people are forgetting the overall context of Flik in the group.  Flik was a *continuous* screw-up before he went out to get the warrior bugs.  They literally sent him out of the colony to look for warriors just so they would have time to fix HIS major screw-up.  They were even arguing about what his punishment should be but couldnt figure one out cause he's apparently had, and subsequently messed up, every single job he's been given.  So they aren't discounting the bird plan because ""oh Flik lied so theres no way that plan will work.""  They're discounting it because he's literally **NEVER** had a plan that DIDNT make things worse.  

On top of that, they think him saying ""The Bird will Work"" is just him trying to cover his own Ego rather than to save everyone.  He lied about the Warrior bugs the ENTIRE time they were there and if the grasshoppers came, they would've been no help whatsoever without the bird plan.  NOT telling the truth actively put the entire colony at risk as they weren't rushing to gather extra food for the grasshoppers.  They think he kept the lie going to just protect HIMSELF, so him insisting on the bird plan sounds like he's still protecting HIMSELF over the colony.

Again, I understand people don't like the Liar revealed trope, and I won't say this is a 'groundbreaking' take on it or anything, but the ants don't think his plan will work cause he's screwed up every single idea he's ever had.  Its not just because ""oh he lied, therefore it wont work.""",Bladebrent,1h9vury,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9vury/im_gonna_defend_the_liar_revealed_trope_in_bugs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9vury/im_gonna_defend_the_liar_revealed_trope_in_bugs/,2024-12-08 23:24:47,0,0.39,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9vury

movies,"Revisiting ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" critiquing it on its own merit, I found it to be a pretty bad film.","This is a sort of Mandella Effect with me, but after rewatching the film only remembering bits and pieces of it when I was younger, I was surprised how small the guardian angel imagination sequence actually is. I thought this was the bulk of the 2nd act originally, but it happens after the film almost reaches its 2-hour runtime. The impact this film has in popular culture is completely dependent on those final 20 minutes.   


If you look up the plot of the film on an website, it will say a variation of ""An angel is sent from Heaven to help a desperately frustrated businessman by showing him what life would have been like if he had never existed.""

This, however, actually happens at the end of film.  This happens about 1 hour and 50 minutes into it. So, this cannot be the plot of the movie. This could only be the plot of the movie if the first act gave us a brief character development of George in the first act, before Clarence takes him on his excursion, where the film will spend the majority of its runtime. But that is not what happens. The plot of the film is actually more closely aligned with, ""A businessman is at financial and personal dilemma when a wealthy tycoon has sights to take over his business and have completely control over the city.""

The only reason this is listed as a plot is the impact its had in culture rather than the film on its own merit.

Other things:

The film opens with an exchange of George, Violet and Mary and children. Violet and Mary both fawn over George.

The way the film opens, you'd think this would foreshadow Violet and Mary feuding over Goerge as adults, or George having to choose one. Opening with the 3 of them suggests these 3 are going to be the main characters later. But no. Adult Violet isn't really integral to the plot at all. Kid Violet has more lines than adult Violet. The opening scene sets something up that didn't end up happening.  

A 7-year-old Violet's innocent crushes on ""a lot of boys"" is somehow offensively supposed to foreshadow that adult Violet is promiscuous. Women who are promiscuous and exotic dancers don't generally start showing signs of this at 7, and it's completely unrelated to any crushes she'd have at that age. 

They spent too much on the opening scene when the only two plot points it needed was to show that George saved the druggist from a fatal error, and George liked exploring. The druggist ended up being an insignificant character later on, so there's no need to spend so much time here. 

George is mildly surprised that Mary is ""18"" as if they just met, yet doesn't seem to remember Mary from childhood. Young Mary didn't just come into the pharmacy that one time; she knew George quite well. Young Mary whispered in his ear ""I'll love you 'til the day I die,"" so they were well acquainted with each other as children.  In fact, there is never a callback to the child years, as if the opening scene was tacked-on later.

We didn't need the narrator exposition by the angels. We didn't need to the conversation by the angels at the introduction about who George is. Clarence's first appearance could've been when he was drowning, and that would've been fine.  There's enough exposition that Clarence is an angel after Clarence saved him (or George saved Clarence) that we didn't need the opening exposition.   
  
If we already see Clarence in human form, then what was the point of the star sequence anyway, which was also horrible special effects even by 1946 standards? The movie could've opened with Clarence in human form simply could've been conversing with the two other angels off-screen.  There was no point in showing them as stars. This seems like a tacked-on reshoot when they didn't have the actors available. 

Officer Ernie spots George by the bridge and says he's been looking for him all night. George is ecstatic he's back to his normal life and leaves. However, if Ernie had been looking for George all night, then he would've stopped at Martini's Bar prior the bridge, where the patrons would've told Ernie that George left drunk. Additionally, Ernie would've found out about the accident. Regardless of his friendship with Ernie, George still should've or would've been detained for drunk driving and leaving the scene of accident. 

When Freddie opens the gym floor to engage the pool- he's told George and Mary are right over the crack.  Freddie opens this floor, and George and Mary are dancing away from the crack at this point. There're a lot of other dancers closer to the opening than they are, and manage to see and avoid it. But coincidentally, George and Mary are the only two that don't see it and fall in accidentally. The two people that Freddie targeted are the two people that happen to fall in despite them not being any more likely than any one else at the dance. What should have happened was, as soon as the floor opened, everyone started falling in. 

Finally, there's an unresolved arc for the main villain. Potter stealing the money isn't addressed, nor is he shown to be defeated overall. 

In sum, it's a badly made film, and the initial reviews are negative, but it does have an cultural impact but that's mostly because it's shown during every Christmas season through decades of rewatch.

- The original Suspira uses different primary colours to convey different emotion.

movies,The Return,"Just finished watching The Return with my wife, and we both enjoyed it. I’m a fan of the Classics and knew the story pretty well. She thought she’d read some Homer in high school, but didn’t know the story. 

Here’s a quick rundown of our thoughts:

	•	Ralph Fiennes is fantastic, as usual. His performance alone is worth watching, and he definitely deserves a Best Actor nod.
	•	Fiennes spends a lot of the film basically naked, and it’s clear he trained hard for the role—impressive dedication!
	•	The movie focuses only on the final third of The Odyssey and takes a few liberties with the story. But the key plot points are there and handled well.
	•	Visually, it’s stunning. The set design and cinematography are top-notch.
	•	The pacing was my one gripe—it drags at times and could’ve used a tighter edit.
	•	One major omission: the gods are completely absent. A big part of Homer’s original was the divine meddling, and the movie doesn’t even mention them. Homer would not approve!

movies,Galaxy Quest censorship theory.,"For those that haven't seen the movie, absolutely worth the watch, it is the best Star Trek movie made. There is a theory out there that talks about the movie censored a line to achieve a PG13 rating. A scene towards the end takes place where Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen have to navigate through a booby trap inside the ship. When Sigourney Weaver sees the trap, she exclaims ""Well, screw that!"" while mouthing the words ""Well, fuck that!"".

I have a second theory. The premise of the movie is the main characters are former actors of a show, much like Star Trek, and have washed up and struggling to get by. One day, Tim Allen is confronted by strange people at a convention. They claim that they are in danger, and Tim Allen is the only one who can help. He mistakes them as just kooky fans and agrees to meet with them thinking it is a gig. He is instead abducted and taken aboard a ship that is based off the ship on the show he was the star of.

It turns out, these aren't fans, they are a species of alien that have based their entire culture around Galaxy Quest, the TV show. Thinking the show was a factual documentary, they received the signals from earth and practically worshiped the show, replicating everything around them to be as accurate as it would have been in the show. To include how they speak.

TL;DR the aliens would have had something on the ship that would censor any curse words. The TV show was on national television in the 80's and would not have any curse words, therefore the aliens would not allow curse words.

Edit: Yes, I know the movie is known to have been more raunchy and likely has an R rated cut, this is more of a fan theory that gives it an in universe explanation.",JDubStep,1h9wx56,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9wx56/galaxy_quest_censorship_theory/,2024-12-09 00:16:35,0,0.29,0,0,5,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9wx56

movies,"[Movie Search] Animated kid Christmas movie ca 2014-2016, does anyone know it?","Edit: It has been solved, its called ""Santas magical crystal""
If the mods wanna take it down because its been solved they can do it


Hi reddit, as you can see from the title I'm looking for a animated christmas movie that aired on tv back in 2014-2016 (i think) in german on Super RTL. Its a kids movie with an art style similar to 'lady bug catnoir' and 'scooby doo mystery incorporated'.

The main character a boy about 10-12 somehow ends up with Santa claus fighting an evil black bearded santa with a trio of elf girl special forces. These girls have some aort of levitation-y power that the can use by tapping a snowflake on the left side of their neck around where the big vein is.
The girls end up getting trapped and about to be hit by either some deathly laser machine or sunk into lava or an shredder. The MC reacues them by them sharing their levitation with him and at the end fight the evil santa gets the good santas power to clone himself hundreds of time.
The end fight happens in this big room with moving rings around it thats similar to a ""Grand Orrery Model of the Solarsystem"" where you can also get teleported to the houses (i think).
I also remeber the leader of the trio force to first hate the mc and then be more friendly to the end because he rescued them all.

movies,Snow White and The Huntsman -- weird but I don't hate it,"For some reason we have this on BR and we ended up putting it on the other night, not having seen it in probably a decade. And yes, it's a really fucking weird movie, but in some ways it totally works. Obviously there's an emphasis on visuals, which change throughout the movie to reflect the the land's hope vs despair (a la Pride Rock). But this movie has some other things going for it as well. Charlize is crazy but legitimately scary. Kristen Stewart is great, even though she doesn't actually talk all that much for most of the runtime. Plus it's got a banger of an end credits song, courtesy of Florence and the Machine.

The movie has some interesting themes as well. Most prominent is the fear of death and aging, which I think is always going to be subtext of this story. Snow White represents youth, beauty, and purity, which can never last; the pursuit of these things rots the Evil Queen's soul. Aside from making this subtext text, and the obvious feminist interpretations/implications, Snow White and the Huntsman also carries a pretty obvious environmental message. The Evil Queen steals beauty and vitality from not just her people, but the actual land as well, transforming the enchanted forest from a vibrant fairyland into a desolate wasteland.

All that said, the pacing can be really weird. The first twenty minutes is basically backstory, as Snow White's mother dies, the Queen takes control of the kingdom, Snow is imprisoned, and finally she escapes to the enchanted forest, when the huntsman, ostensibly one of the main characters, finally enters the picture. The middle of the movie is a little confusing, because the title characters don't seem to really have goals other than surviving. The poisoned apple and Snow White's coma transition pretty abruptly into the climactic battle, as well.

So yeah, it's weird, and you can point out a few flaws, but it's also a beautifully dark movie with a lot of heart and a pretty clear message. What do you think?

All these PG-13 movies I listed after School of Rock have more extreme inappropriate content then the higher R rated Kings Speech and Steve jobs movie.

Now imagine parents of children that blindly go off the age ratings just because it has a higher rating then how old their child is they don't let their children watch it.

You would rather want children to watch the R rated Steve Jobs and Kings Speech rather then PG-13 stuff like Split and The Dark Knight.

movies,The Departed 2006 - Second undercover cop.,"So there is a lot of back and forth on Delahunt being a cop or not. Most say it's ambiguous. Most say that Costello is right, when he says that police wanted them to believe he was a cop, to throw them off from the real one. 

But right now rewatching it, I noticed a little scene about 1:40 into the movie. So Sullivan is checking the names of the guys he was given in the envelope. He looks at the picture of Delahunt and yet when he types in his social security number, he gets an error noise, and a message that person is not found. We instantly cut back to Delahunt giving another guy pointers on how to find a cop. Sullivan types in another social security code, and we get a little beep sound like the computer accepted that one. Back on the street, Billy walks out and Delahunt jokingly calls him a cop. And back to Sullivan, he types in Billy's name, and gets another 'person not found' message, and error sound. So in a scene where Delahunt jokes about spotting cops, the two people Sullivan can't get info on at all, are Delahunt and Billy? And this happens just before everything with Delahunt, from him not ratting out Billy, to him being declared a cop on tv. So uhh, I don't think it was for no reason, that Sullivan got two errors on his computer. I think it was just a little hint that not everything about Delahunt was as it seems.

Also, when Billy said that he doesn't have a bank account, Delahunt was the only one to say that he is a cash business himself too.

Edit: for people saying that it was not ambiguous, well I read up on quite a few posts before making mine, and there is no clear answer.

movies,"In The Count of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviezel, I believe that after so many lies from Fernand and Mercedes, I believed that at the end of the film, Edmond became a misanthrope.","The adaptation with Jim Caviziel appears to be an unintentional parody of the book.

The scene of French high society going to an unknown foreign nobleman's party and him descending from a balloon seemed like a parody of the book. French high society was closed off and the Count acting like a nouveau riche would bring the contempt of the French elite to him. The Count needed someone to open the doors of high society for him. This scene had a comedic tone like the Monty Python movies.

Albert is kidnapped by Luigi's gang and a stranger with a sword appears out of nowhere and saves him, giving a lame excuse when it was supposed to arouse suspicion that the kidnapping was set up.

And the mediocre revenges of the terrible 2002 film. The Count uses the treasure to attract Fernand and Danglars , but it is such an obvious trap that anyone would suspect it and not fall for the trick.

And the way the Count makes Villefort confess to his crime, what an amateur thing. An experienced man like Villefort would never confess his crime with such an amateur trick as the one in the 2002 film.

It would be much better if the Count hired Luigi Vampa 's gang to execute Danglars and Villefort like Michael Corleone executed Moe Greene, Tattaglia and Barzini in the Godfather . And he strangles Fernand like Clemenza strangled Carlo Rizzi . Contrary  the logic of the book to inflict prolonged suffering on his adversaries, but it would be a smarter way for the count to get rid of his enemies.

And Edmond reconciling with Mercedes was hilariously poorly written. She was married for years to the man who sent Edmond to a dungeon and you would think there would be a happy ending for them. She shows him a ring and Edmond starts crying saying something worthy of a comedy: “Don't steal my hate, it's all I have.”  Only in the movies do these absurdities happen. In a realistic situation, he would never forget that Mercedes was married to Fernand for years and had sex with him, while he rotted at the Château D' If . And he thinks that even if she claimed she was pregnant with his child, that would not erase or justify to Edmond Mercedes' marriage to Fernand. And worse, she lied and deceived. Wouldn't this help Edmond become a misanthrope like Gullinver ? Even the woman he loved proved to be an untrustworthy person.The couple reconciles and there is no resentment on Edmond's part for his former fiancée marrying Fernand or for having lied or deceived. And Albert discovers that he is the count's son and everything is fine, no trauma or questioning on Mercedes' part.

I thought that in the end, Edmond, tired of all the lies and deceit he had lived, would become a misanthrope like Gullinver . After all, the people close to him had proven to be untrustworthy. He would start to avoid human presence. Gullinver at the end of the book avoids the presence of his family In Livor, Mercedes was an honorable woman and that is why Edmond respected her.",cleopatraandcaesar63,1h9kgw4,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9kgw4/in_the_count_of_monte_cristo_with_jim_caviezel_i/,2024-12-08 14:53:16,0,0.23,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h9kgw4

movies,Losing your local movie theater,"When it opened in 1999 as a Carmike, my local movie theater was the premier high-tech theater of the future in the area. I saw Star Wars Episode 1 there 3 times. I saw the whole Lord of the Rings series &amp; probably something like 150 other movies there over the years. My roommate worked there for quite a while.

Except for switching to digital projection around 2005, it never really got updated, though. Carmike went under. Most of their other theaters were closed, but this one sold to AMC in 2016. They never did anything with it, either. They just kept showing movies as it slowly decayed. It was an AMC Classic where evening tickets for new releases were only $8 &amp; the only theater on the south side of town, but business slowly dropped off. My girlfriend and I saw Endgame there at 8pm on opening night &amp; there were only about 8 other people.

The last movie I saw there was The Way Back, a drama with Ben Affleck as an alcoholic basketball coach. This was March 15, 2020. Two days later, it closed for COVID &amp; never reopened. At the point it closed, it still had the original carpet, which was badly stained &amp; full of holes &amp; the original seats, many of which were broken &amp; could not safely support a person.

movies,"The Count of Monte Cristo (2024) - A terrible adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic. The screenwriters didn't understand that the Count would be a mix of Job, Joseph, Raskonilkov and Ulysses and made the Count a kind of masked vigilante.","

The Count of Monte Cristo from Alexandre Dumas' classic would be a story of Joseph (son of Jacob), Job , Raskonilkov (Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky ) and Ulysses ( the Oydsey by Homer )

 A man with a tragic past, many scores to settle, an insatiable thirst for justice and *a lot of* money to spend on it, who returns to his home country years after being struck by a tragedy, with new fighting skills, disguises and unlikely allies in his mission to bring vigilante justice to criminals, all while dressed almost eternally in a black uniform. If the reader thought “Batman!”, know that the author did too; but, according to the French, this is none other than Edmond Dantès , Alexandre Dumas’ Count of Monte Cristo. Apparently.

 

One would expect the French to have greater respect for their own literary heritage, but apparently not. The new French film adaptation of the work, starring Pierre Niney and acclaimed in France, though why is beyond this author’s comprehension, makes this abundantly clear. Dumas’s masterpiece is altered so significantly that it is once again virtually unrecognizable; once again it is transformed into a story that completely contradicts everything Dumas intended in his book. “The greatest revenge story of all time” is reduced to the most vulgar, superficial level of its existence—skin and bones, a melodramatic, caricatured serial novel.

Edmond Dantès de Niney is almost a superhero. He is an expert in hand-to-hand combat , undergoing a *training montage* which makes no sense at all – apparently, the Prisoner of Château d' If was hell, and yet he had enough strength, energy, space and freedom to train in combat with an Abbé Faria -, leaves his insignia as a mark after beating up several ""tough guys"" on a street corner (tough guys hired by him, let's make that clear), is always wearing a black coat almost reminiscent of a cape, has in his house (heavily produced by CGI) a closet that becomes a shooting target when he presses a button, and uses masks and latex prosthetics with an almost comical proficiency.

 

In many ways, the film is reminiscent of the French Netflix series “ Lupin ,” which adapts Arsene ’s classics. Lupin , the Burglar, for modernity. But “ Lupin ” is a modern adaptation, not a direct one – the series revolves around a fan of the books who commits crimes inspired by them in the 21st century, and does not directly adapt any story from the books featuring the character Arsene. Lupin – and, above all, one that doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is excellent for what it sets out to do, with all its absurdities and moments of comedy. If the new Monte Cristo had followed the same approach, the situation would be entirely different – this could be a more youthful, fun and intelligent adaptation of Dumas' wonderful book – but that is not what happens. The film wants to be taken seriously, and it wants to be a direct adaptation of Dumas' book, and that is why it fails.

The film is a modern, youthful, almost Marvel Cinematic approach. Universe – without considering itself as such, the main source of ridicule in this whole farce – of a classic that deserves much better than this. It adds totally unnecessary action scenes – including scenes of Monte Cristo fighting hand-to- hand with several men in the middle of the street *and* the infamous duel (in the case of this specific adaptation, one was not enough; there are *two* duels, one with pistols and one with swords, invented for the film for no reason other than to follow in the footsteps of its equally mediocre predecessors) that half the Monte Cristo adaptations insist on including, despite Dumas's deliberate choice to subvert the expectations of his genre and purposefully avoid cliché, and to compensate he cuts buckets and buckets of nuance and narrative delicacy.

 

It is clear that it is impossible to expect a perfect adaptation of a classic of over 1,500 pages into a film, even if that film is almost three hours long. Even the greatest classics of cinema, with all their brilliance, have not managed to do so – Gone with the Wind…, Ben-Hur , etc. Yet, these same classics – and other more modern ones, such as Les Misérables from 2012, for example (speaking of which, Victor Hugo has not slept in the Pantheon for decades because his grave neighbor, Dumas, has been struggling in his own coffin since at least 2002, when the adaptation of Monte Cristo with Jim Caviziel hit theaters. Please, someone help him.) – have already proven that it is possible to make a good adaptation of masterful, complex and, of course, immense books in a relatively short space of time. The secret is to preserve what really matters – and that is where Monte Cristo with Niney fails.

First of all, let's talk about the man of the moment: Edmond Dantès , *the* Count of Monte Cristo. What was done to Dumas' protagonist was outrageous. The problem is not exactly Niney - although he doesn't help either - but his characterization.

 

The clothes, the laughable aging, the disheveled hair, all of this contrasts so ridiculously with Dumas's elegant, refined, sophisticated, and utterly charming yet arrogant Monte Cristo, who took over Parisian society in the space of a few months, that it is hard to believe that the character is the same person. His methods are equally crass, and infinitely less sophisticated than those of his literary counterpart, and for this, the character suffers.

An excellent example of this tragic character deconstruction is what happens to Monte Cristo to save Albert. For some inexplicable reason – not even the shorter and, in theory, less concerned with details film of 2002 makes this mistake – the Italian narrative is completely omitted. So, so that Monte Cristo has an excuse to get close to Albert, he fakes a robbery himself, hiring men to do it, just to have the opportunity to beat them all up in the middle of the street and “save the boy’s life”.

A significant difference from the well-structured plan described in the book, during which Monte Cristo, over the course of several days, befriends and displays his immense wealth to Albert and his friend Franz D' Epinay during the Roman Carnival, arranging for the young man to eventually be kidnapped, and then negotiating his release with Luigi Vampa , the feared Italian bandit responsible for the crime – and Monte Cristo's debtor, who used his influence with the Pope to save the life of one of his men – for no money at all, thus ensuring that the two young men returned to Paris not only grateful and willing to do anything for their new friend, but also impressed and ready to spread throughout French high society fabulous stories about the legendary wealth, courage, phlegm and power of a man who has as much influence in the Vatican as in the European criminal underworld.

Dumas’s Count of Monte Cristo would never hire men just to beat them up. This is humiliating for a man who prided himself with an almost irritating sense of self-importance on his near-superhuman ability to do, well, anything. When the Count does fight someone, he fights them, period—and wins on his own merit. But most of all, Dumas’s Monte Cristo would *never* go toe-to-toe with “tough guys” on a street corner, even if the fight were paid for. He solves his problems with telegrams, money, and pistols, not *bartitsu* . He doesn’t lay a finger on *anyone* , and he’s all the more effective and lethal for it.

 

Adding violence in the name of action is a common problem with adaptations of Monte Cristo. The book is often classified as a “swashbuckler novel” – and while it is, to some extent, it is a simplistic classification, as Dumas is deliberate in avoiding certain clichés and common tropes of the genre.

He creates the entire scenario of the duel (an almost mandatory item to be included in this type of novel in the 19th century), for example, but purposely does not let it happen, subverting the expectations of his readers and making his story more sophisticated because of it – since the resolution to the duel occurs in a surprisingly beautiful and emotionally profound way, which makes a huge difference not only in the development of the characters' arcs but in the narrative as a whole – and it is a shame that adapters “correct” this perceived “failure” to align with the literary expectations of their supposed category. In this film, it is no different: two duels, in addition to the laughable fight in the middle of the street, are added to the story, always at the expense of complex and well-constructed narratives, which in the book involve the emotional and psychological state of the characters, and in the film are nothing more than action sequences without further details.

But if that were all, perhaps it would be possible to save the film. But, of course, it isn’t. As is customary in mediocre adaptations – yes, 2002, I’m talking to you directly – the villains of Monte Cristo are completely mischaracterized to such a crass level of exaggeration that it becomes childish. Due to lack of time, no doubt, but equally due to lack of imagination and understanding of the text, Villefort , Danglars and Mondego are transformed into people so devoid of any human characteristics that it is almost possible to hear the echo of an evil laugh every time one of them enters the room. This author more or less expected one of them to stroke his mustache maliciously while giving a speech about his infallible plan to dominate the world, *a la the* mad scientist from a children’s film – Dr. Heinz. Doofenshmirtz , the comedic villain from the Disney Channel cartoon “ Phineas and Ferb ,” is frankly a more intelligently written and less stereotypical character.

Dumas’ characters are men who can be found in any high society salon today, just as they might have been in his time: family men, with varying degrees of love for their children and wives and involvement in domestic life; businessmen, with varying degrees of competence and probity; well-liked men , very pleasant and sometimes even too nice. Men, in short, ordinary, but with more than one terrible secret. Men who have their qualities, but succumb to their weaknesses – ambition, greed, passion, flattery, instincts of survival and self-preservation – all too often. These are the nuances that make them so real, so credible and so despicable, without, at one time or another, we fail to feel some degree of sympathy for one or two of them. These are the nuances so undignifiedly thrown out the window, like the corpses in The Prisoner. of Château d' If , for this production.

Let’s start with Fernand. Following the pattern established on other occasions – most famously by the 2002 film starring Caviziel – Mercedes’ envious cousin can’t just be that; he *has to be* Dantès ’ best friend . How, after all, are we supposed to know he’s a despicable person if he doesn’t betray *his best friend* out of jealousy and ambition? How, oh my God, can we not like a villain if he’s not completely and irremediably that – despicable? And he’s rich, of course. Don’t let Dumas’s poor, ambitious Mondego, willing to do anything to climb the career ladder, appear on a movie screen. He has to be a rich nobleman and, let’s not forget, *despicable* from the start, or he won’t do. He’s so caricatured that – and here the author assures us she’s not joking, despite what it might seem – he wears an eyepatch. Is there anything more appropriate for a cartoon villain than an eyepatch ?

He and Dantès have a showdown at the end of the film – a sword duel that never happens in the literary counterpart of the story, and which has none of the dignity of Dumas. The author's Monte Cristo never crosses swords with Morcef , he is too calculating for that. His revenge is much more sophisticated, and ends with Morcef himself committing suicide – too cowardly, and perhaps too disturbed, to even consider going through with a duel with the newly revealed Edmond Dantès . Far superior, without a doubt, is Monte Cristo's foolish display of mercy when he defeats his enemy and lets him live, something simultaneously out of character and meaningless for the construction of the narrative as it was.

Danglars is made equally over-the-top in his villainy, which is a shame, as he was already brilliantly *despicable* and, frankly, disgusting in the original, and didn't need these additions - but he gets them, of course. In Dumas's book, the character was an accountant who had ambitions to become captain of the Pharaon , and who becomes jealous when the young First Mate, Dantès , is promoted to the position. After Dantès 's arrest , he receives the promotion, and eventually leaves the sea life to become a corrupt and greedy banker who puts money above all else - including his family. In the film, he is already captain, and is demoted from the position, which is given to Dantès , after refusing to save a drowning woman, which Dantès does in his place.

 

He rises in the world by becoming a slave trader. He is directly responsible for the destruction of the Morrel family , sabotaging their ships – the Morrels ’ situation in the book is simply a natural case of bad luck, with their ships sinking over the years – and leading Morrel to die in poverty – something that, once again, does not happen, because in the book Dantès is able to save his friend from suicide *in extremis* , an occasion that, in fact, serves to show the good side of the protagonist, who makes a point of rewarding those who were good to him over the years before punishing those who did him wrong, without ever denouncing himself as the author of their good deeds. Danglars finally comes to effectively admit with pride that he is a brute in his first lines – in case the rest of the story is not enough for the audience to realize it, of course.

Danglars is one of the most unbearable and realistic villains in his work, precisely because he is an extremely ordinary man - corrupt, cowardly, envious, greedy, selfish, affected, unctuous, sycophantic, ridiculous in his petty pettiness. He has no legitimate reason to feel wronged by Dantès - the position of captain was never his, and in fact it made more sense as a natural promotion for the First Mate than for the accountant, anyway. He makes his wealth like countless men before him - by stealing from the poor and from the public coffers. He sells himself to men richer than himself – opening the doors of his house to the billionaire Count of Monte Cristo without thinking twice, when moments before he had tried to belittle him, unaware of his absurd amount of money, and accepting Prince Andrea Cavalcanti as his son-in-law without even bothering to check anything about his life, all in the name of the title of prince –, he practically auctions off his daughter to the buyer – read, future husband – willing to pay the most, and accepts his wife's humiliating affair with the journalist Lucien Debray , who goes out in public with Danglars 's wife and daughter and visits his mistress at her husband's house, with him present, in exchange for inside information on the stock exchange. There was no need to change such a brilliant villain precisely because he was so good at generating disgust. He was already terrible enough in his own pettiness.

And what about Villefort , the most complex of all the three villains in Monte Cristo? Dumas's Villefort is not, at first, a bad man; just ambitious and insecure. He knows that Dantès is innocent and is about to release him; however, when he discovers that the letter that was used to incriminate the boy was written by his father, and that his career could be completely ruined by it, he decides to keep him imprisoned. This simple but perfectly plausible and reasonable story is replaced by one of the biggest changes in the 2024 film – Villefort 's father , Noitier , is replaced by his sister, Angele (nonexistent in Dumas's narrative), whom Dantès saves from drowning, and who is carrying a letter for Napoleon. Not only does Villefort arrest the man who saved his sister's life, he is violent towards her, hanging her until she is nearly dead, and then handing her over to Danglars to turn into a prostitute-slave. Years later, Monte Cristo finds her destroyed by years of sexual servitude, and she dies soon after.

The Villefort of the 2024 film is so cartoonish that he is not even given the family he has in the book – a bad man cannot , it seems, care for his children, care for his father, or have a wife. This not only eliminates one of the most unusual plot lines in the book – that Villefort ’s second wife , Heloise, is a serial killer who is murdering all the family members to ensure that Villefort ’s inheritance goes entirely to her son, Edouard – but it considerably diminishes the complexity of Monte Cristo’s revenge, both in terms of his actions themselves and in terms of the moral and emotional depth of it for both Villefort and Monte Cristo himself.

The fact that he dies is tragic – after all, the book's revenge is delicious precisely because Villefort stays alive and is forced to live with all his worst nightmares coming true at once. All of this, however, is sacrificed for a simple death and a villain without a shred of humanity – and, if that weren't enough, the director makes a point of placing hanged bodies rotting in front of Villefort 's office , in case, once again, his villainy wasn't obvious.

This destruction of the characters is sad to watch, because all three are some of the best, most real and human individuals ever created by the author. Dumas' villains are real men, and *for that reason* they are despicable; because they are men like those we can find in various sectors of society, in real life, today, as we could find before. Because they are not monsters, just corrupt, petty and cowardly people . Real-life villains.

How many slave traders, pimps for their own sisters, and forgers of the imprisonment and disgrace of their best friends were walking around in 19th-century France? A certain number, no doubt, but nowhere near as many as the politicians, bankers, military men, and civil servants who embezzle public funds, issue convictions bought for their own interests, commit crimes that remain hidden abroad, get rid of the children they have with their mistresses, forge entire careers on flattery and political changes at the right time, and trample on probity, justice, honesty, and, above all, on poor, nameless innocents as if they were the dust under their shoes. How many *of these* were there in Dumas’s France? How many of these are there today?

Are they not deserving enough of an audience's hatred?

The adaptation's allergy to nuance and realism in the balance between good and evil, however, also works in reverse: at least two bad characters from Dumas's book are redeemed in a completely inexplicable way in the film, becoming heroic and admirable figures that would surprise Dumas himself. They are Caderrouse and Benedetto.

There is not much to say about Caderrouse ; it is enough to point out that, while in the book he is a man so greedy that he kills his wife – and meets his own death – for money (but who, despite this, feels remorse for his role as a passive observer in the imprisonment of the innocent Dantès ), in the film he becomes a man who is presented with a diamond and refuses it in the name of his moral principles.

Benedetto, also known as Prince Andrea Cavalcanti, is a special case: the character in the book is, in fact, a psychopath or something like that, being not only a terrible criminal, but also willing to torture his (adoptive) mother and kill his supposed father (he believes he is the illegitimate son of Monte Cristo, whom he tries to murder. Eventually, he discovers he is the son of Villefort ). Millions of leagues away from the Benedetto of the 2024 film – a progressive hero willing to marry a lesbian woman to help her hide her interest in women, kind, polite, and who lives as an adopted son of Monte Cristo, who has great affection for him (significantly different from Dumas's Monte Cristo's opinion of Benedetto, which, in his own words, disgusts him).

Benedetto's death – nonexistent in the book – while taking revenge on his father, Villefort , is one of the saddest and, in theory, most emotionally charged moments in the film, and it is what makes Monte Cristo doubt the justice of his actions. It took the place of the death of Edouard de Villefort , Villefort 's young son . And, of course, it makes no sense. After all, Monte Cristo begins to have doubts after seeing his revenge result in the death of an innocent man – a seven-year-old child who had no connection with his father's crimes and no part in his plan. How is it possible to transfer this same degree of guilt for the death of a boy who was as interested in revenge as he was – after all, Benedetto in the film also wanted to end Villefort , and dies doing so – and who participated willingly and enthusiastically in his plan? The answer is “impossible”. The choice renders much of Dantès 's doubts meaningless or, at the very least, out of proportion, and eliminates some of the most dramatic scenes and most significant moments of the narrative in its wake.

Early in his revenge plot in the 2024 film, Dantès goes to a church and angrily tells Jesus that from now on he will do what God was clearly unwilling to do – serve justice. Although dramatic – reminiscent of Bram ’s Dracula Stoker with Gary Oldman , even -, the scene once again contradicts everything Dumas writes in his book. The literary Count of Monte Cristo would not commit this kind of blasphemy, not necessarily out of immense faith and fear of God, but because he sees things in a completely different way.

One of the main themes of Dumas's “The Count of Monte Cristo” is the *Dies Irae* , divine wrath. This is because the Count himself positions himself as an agent of divine providence, and justifies all his actions as being part of God's will. He understands that he was rescued from D' If and gifted with his fabulous fortune to serve as a divine agent who dispenses justice like the God of the Old Testament, and that it is God's will that his vengeance be carried out. He would never ""argue"" with Jesus about his lack of action, because he understands that everything that happened to make him a Count was his action. He is not acting because God did not do it; he is acting because God compels him. And this aspect is fundamental not only for the symbolic and thematic integrity of the narrative constructed by Dumas, but also for the psychological aspect of the protagonist, who feels perfectly justified in his notion of justice and bases many of his actions on this reasoning.

 

This erasure of themes linked to the Old Testament – which is explored in the book, by the way, through a much more philosophical than religious approach – is also connected to several disappearances of characters extremely relevant to the story, but which the film cuts out completely: Maximilien Morrel , Luigi Vampa , Bertuccio , Edouard de Villefort , Heloise de Villefort , Monsieur Noitier , Hermine Danglars , Valentine de Villefort , Franz D' Epinay , and, of course, the modification of the roles of characters such as Haydée, Benedetto and Caderrousse . These disappearances have gigantic consequences for the plot, which has to be developed in a completely different way to accommodate the absence of certain characters, since Dumas structured his narrative in such a way that even the most insignificant events and minuscule characters are fundamental to the functioning of the story.

It is important to realize that almost all of the characters mentioned are members of certain characters' families. There are a number of implications for each of these cuts individually, but as a collective example, nothing better than the Villefort axis of the narrative: after all, without Heloise de Villefort , Hermine Danglars , Noitier , Edouard , Valentine and Morrel , how does Gerard de Villefort 's Monte Cristo get revenge ? The 2024 film resolves this with a death at the hands of Benedetto, something reasonably better than his senseless death in the 2002 film, but a simplistic solution when compared to the sophistication and true family drama that Dumas' Edmond engenders, involving poisons, serial murders, a faked death, an illegitimate son, an Italian criminal, a baby buried alive and a high-caliber public trial, resulting in the judge going mad, who begins to dig up his backyard in search of the son he had buried two decades earlier, having his reputation - the very thing he condemned Dantès to protect - ruined and his family torn apart.

Similarly, what prompts the Count of Monte Cristo to reflect on the justice of his revenge if there is no little Edouard there ? Haydée, the adaptation says, for the princess reminds the Count of the price of his revenge after the death of the reformed Benedetto, for whom Monte Cristo and she herself have great affection. It has already been discussed why Benedetto as a catalyst for this particular drama does not work, and now it remains to speak briefly of the implications of this for the character of Haydée.

This act of killing an innocent person that leads to questioning his actions , precedes Raskonilkov in Crime and Punishment. He kills the innocent, Lizaveta . Ivanovna  who was the pawnbroker 's sister Alyona Ivanovna made Raskonilkov question his theory about the Great Man, that extraordinary men in the name of the common good could transgress social rules.

Haydée is a character who is often misunderstood , and this time was no different. The fact that she appears in the film is already a great victory – most adaptations don’t even bother to do this – but that doesn’t mean that her character wasn’t, as expected, destroyed. It’s easy to think of Haydée as a mere accessory, one more detail in the calculated identity created by Edmond Dantès to enchant Paris as a millionaire, eccentric and orientalist aristocrat – and therein lies one of the great misinterpretations of the work. Not only does Haydée play a major role in the revenge plot that the Count has been hatching for a decade, but the revenge in question is also hers: one of the men who wrongly accused Dantès , taking him to prison in D' If , to marry his then fiancée, Mercedes, is the same one who betrayed her father's trust, killed him, and sold Haydée and her mother into slavery – Fernand Mondego, the Count of Morcef .

Haydée is as vengeful as Monte Cristo. She is angry. She is deceitful, and she is a match for the Count in every way, part of a Machiavellian duo who have spent years plotting revenge. Haydée is not simply a pawn on Monte Cristo’s chessboard, much less the voice of conscience on his shoulder: for all we know, she is his partner in the game, and does more to encourage him than to stop him. Like him, she has suffered immensely at the hands of her enemies, and like him she has a deep desire for revenge. There is, however, one fundamental difference between the two: unlike Edmond, Haydée seems immune to any kind of remorse.

This is the fundamental aspect of their relationship—a sadly underdeveloped aspect of the Count-Princess dynamic in many adaptations, and one that is effectively ignored in 2024. Haydée may be a source of peace for Monte Cristo, but she is certainly not a numbing agent. She does not help him forget the demons that haunt him, because her presence in his life is entirely conditioned by the existence of those demons. He would never have met her if he had not been searching for ways to disgrace the man who put him in prison. Haydée is not oblivion: she is a reminder of the horrors committed by those whom Edmond destroyed, and that he was justified in his anger. And unlike him, Haydée seems to be completely at peace and content with everything that has happened.

She has no doubts – and perhaps that helps Edmond feel at peace. And, in the end, she is also probably the only person in Dumas’s entire narrative who gets everything she wants. To take that away from her – to make her a young woman in love with *Albert* , completely ignoring her narrative function as Dantès ’s romantic partner , and to make her a spokesperson for remorse and morality on the Count’s shoulder – is to diminish and decomplexify one of Dumas’s brilliant and forgotten female characters, who are once again relegated to clichés of goodness and honor.

 Haydee bears a certain resemblance to Sonia Marmeladova from Crime and Punishment. Sonia offers Raskonilkov hope for happiness and a new beginning after he confesses his crime, just as Haydee offers the Count of Monte Cristo the chance for a new beginning after he forgives Danglars . Just as Job had lost everything and gained back twice as much as he had lost, so too did Monte Cristo.

The addition of melodrama doesn’t leave even the inanimate objects untouched: Monte Cristo’s treasure gets a new origin story, so dramatic that it might deserve its own book. It passes through the hands of the Borgias , the famously cruel French king Philip IV the Fair, and the *Knights Templar* – of which Abbé Faria is the last, by the way (At this point, Dumas begins to convulse in his coffin. Émile Zola, his other grave neighbor who is also being prevented from sleeping, accuses the screenwriter who decided that this was a good idea) – before reaching the hands of the sailor from Marseille. Speaking of Faria, he dies from fatal injuries after being crushed in an escape attempt – much more dramatic and less plausible than the death of the Faria in the books, due to a health condition that runs in his family and seems to be something like epilepsy.

 The aforementioned romance between Albert and Haydée – which makes no narrative or thematic sense whatsoever – is another one of those additions that turn the book into a soap opera-like melodrama for no reason at all. How does it happen? We don't know; the film doesn't bother to develop this aspect of the narrative well, certainly not well enough to justify such absurdity ( *please* , think of Hugo and Zola). All we know is that Albert and Haydée decide to run away together, madly in love, even though Albert's father killed Haydée's father, and Haydée was instrumental in the downfall of Albert's father – and family. Monte Cristo forces her to tell him this , of course, because what would become of this romance *a la* Romeo and Juliet if the drama were not made explicit to the entire audience?

That it was a poorly told story is bad enough, but the real problem here is what it means for the arcs of both characters. Haydée’s literary function is, as we’ve already established, to be Monte Cristo’s perfect match; Albert’s is to be a young dandy who develops and becomes a better man through the influence, destructive as it was, of the Count, as he abandons his family’s money and name and renounces all pleasure to enlist in the French army and go fight in Africa as a common man, building his new name, reputation, and wealth from scratch to atone for his father’s crimes—though he didn’t have to.



The ending of the 2024 film is unsatisfying for all possible audiences. On the one hand, those who have not read or care little about Dumas's work generally expect Monte Cristo to end his days married to Mercedes , the ending popularized by many adaptations, including, most famously, the 2002 one. An ending that is exactly the opposite of everything Dumas wanted to say with his book, by the way.

Those who have read the book and are genuinely interested in the author's message, however, expect to see the ending as he wrote it: with Monte Cristo avenged, satisfied but feeling some weight of guilt, sailing east to end his days living as a mistress in the company of Haydée. Not because this is a sugary happy ending – on the contrary, the way it is written, it is quite tempered by a good dose of bitterness – but because it is the right ending.

At the end of 2024’s “ The Count of Monte Cristo,” Monte Cristo is alone. He has achieved his revenge, but he has lost people he cared about, he has suffered immensely, and above all, he has his doubts, however well hidden behind a stoic facade they may be, about the validity of his actions, instilled in him by Haydée de Janina , by Benedetto’s death, and perhaps even by his choice to spare Fernand’s life. He leaves Paris and goes away, leaving a letter behind addressed to Mercedes. A harsh ending, which almost seems to indicate that revenge is not worth it—a point that has been made a thousand times before, and which would have been reasonable if the entire film had not made such a point of making its villains so caricatured and its protagonist so “super-heroic” in his quest for retribution that it borders on incoherent, and above all, if Dumas himself had not written a book that says exactly the opposite.

Dantès even flirts with repentance. That’s all it takes: he is reaffirmed in his revenge time and time again, and even receives a “posthumous message” from his mentor, Faria , which says, “You will tear out the teeth of dragons, and you will trample lions under your feet, says the Lord.” If Dumas had drawn it, he wouldn’t have been so explicit. Dumas’s Edmond is justified in his revenge, he feels that way, and the narrative sees him as such. Casting doubt on this could be an interesting philosophical discussion, but it doesn’t serve an adaptation of the work.

The problem here, as in so many other cases, is a simple misunderstanding of the author’s intent. “The Count of Monte Cristo” has become so widely known as “the greatest revenge story of all time” that for many it has been reduced to that very thing. Let’s not misunderstand: Monte Cristo is indeed a revenge story, and arguably the most essential of them all, in that it has definitively influenced the genre as a whole, including its imitations, such as Ben-Hur , and its subversions, such as Les Misérables. But the point of the story , for Dumas, was never revenge. That’s the fun part, of course. Who doesn’t feel a sense of personal satisfaction when the men who sent an innocent man to prison in order to secure his love, his money, and his reputation end up dead, bankrupt, and disgraced, respectively? These are the narratives that have kept the story, published in installments over the course of a year in a newspaper, interesting to the public for so long. But when you get to the very end—in those final chapters after everything is over—you realize the author had something more important to say. This is not just a story of revenge. It is the story of the fall and rise of a man who was young, and is no longer. Who was innocent, and is no longer. Who was good, and is no longer sure if he still is.

Yesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Slovenia. In a way, we have a double winner: Because it was mentioned in two (and actually more) comments. both 1st and 2nd place are occupied by ***Moj ata, socialistični kulak*** (engl.: *My dad, the socialist kulak*),  As always, I haven't seen the movie yet, but it certainly sounds like an insightful and impressive tragicomedy about issues that are in part even more topical than in 1987, when the movie was released.

I wonder what the next movie will look like? In any case, it will also end up on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). And in any case, let's move on to the next country with an S: In this thread, it's all about movies set in **Spain**. And as always, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

Indiana must race to prevent the vampires from obtaining the Ark, which they plan to use as a weapon to amplify their power, while also uncovering a mysterious connection between the ancient artifact and the vampires' immortality.

**""Deadpool &amp; Amelie""** - Wade Wilson meets his match when he encounters Amelie, a quirky and imaginative French woman with the ability to manipulate those around her in whimsical ways. Wade's chaotic life as a fourth wall-breaking, crime-fighting, mutant vigilante is at odds with Amelie's more innocent, heartfelt, and compassionate approach to life, and their differences slowly transform both individuals in ways that will change them forever. 

**""Paddington vs. Predator""** - A loveable young anthropomorphic bear returns to the Peruvian jungle that was once his home, where a deadly alien Predator also happens to be hunting. Fortunately for Paddington, his kindness and resourcefulness allow him to befriend other animals that help him outwit the Predator’s traps. The Predator becomes increasingly frustrated, leading to even more dangerous encounters, but Paddington manages to turn the tables in a film full of adorable humor and action-packed tension.

movies,Review of Flow 2024,"I approached Flow with high expectations based on its marketing and glowing reviews, particularly regarding its visuals. Unfortunately, it fell short of these promises. The animation, though praised for it's style, felt outdated reminiscing of a role-playing video game back from 2012. While the limited budget was outlined by many, objective ratings should compare Flow to the leaders in the industry, like Dinsey or Pixar.

The film started with intriguing ideas and concepts, but I found it to lack depth and development. It focused heavily on illustrating the flow of life and nature without offering meaningful character arcs and development, to me it felt too superficial. In my opinion stories should engage, inspire, and challenge it's viewers or readers, but again Flow remained superficial and repetitive. Furthermore, it struggled to define its target audience, too slow, long and abstract for children, yet too shallow for adults. This left it in a no-man's land, catering to neither side.

I was really excited for the absence of dialogue, but it felt like a let down. Watching the film felt like a chore, without any emotional payoff. It sure was worth seeing once for curiosity, but I wouldn't watch it again. I'd rate the film give or take a 5-6/10. I think Flow is a film you definitely want to watch in the cinema, and not on your TV.

To be clear, I'm not a professional critic, and the point of this post isn't to bash or devalue the film, I think they did a great job for the shoestring budget they had, but these are my honest thoughts questioning the ""glowing"" reviews Flow has received.

movies,Click (2006) is A Christmas Carol done horribly,"So, both of these stories have the core idea the protagonist must appreciate what they have and live in the moment, rather than focus on their career. And both receive a future vision where things have ended badly.

That is what the story beats of Click clearly intend, but it's incompetent to have its cake. Like the way the third act is filmed, it wants you to think it's a bad future and you should feel bad for Sandler's character. Except, the future in Click isn't actually bad.

* Sandler's wife has remarried a nice guy and seems happy

* Sandler's daughter has become a successful model

* Sandler's son has become a talented manager in his company and has found a wife

But Sandler's character thinks these are all bad developments. He hates his wife's new husband for no reason, looks down on the modeling career of his daughter, and thinks his son will waste his life by focusing on his career (like he did). The only remotely sad thing that happens in that timeline is the father being shunned before dying.

So, Sandler's character is motivated to change his life out of selfishness. He is still the same asshole in the end.

movies,The best R-Rated Comedies,"Being a teen in the late 1990s and early 2000s I grew up on R-rated teen sex comedies, and I love them so much. Unfortunately the genre has kind of died off, but here are some of my highlights over the year. Here a short review of each :)

1. Risky Business (1983): This movie couldn't be made today! A young Tom Cruise's parents are out of town. They expect him to behave and prepare credits for college, but sometimes you just have to say ""what the f\*\*k"" as ""what the f\*\*k"" gives you freedom. This lead Tom to starting his own brothel. The movie is so stylish, and shows how teens have to balance being a good robot for society and the temptations in life. A classic 10/10.
2. American Pie 1-4 (1999-2012): We follow group of guys from when they set out to lose their virginities, to when they get separated in college, having a wedding party and a reunion. These guys have the best chemistry and I love the insane gags like Stifler getting a nasty beer, a nice shower, Jim having fun with a pie and getting glued, Stifler's mom, Finche's mom, and so on. The movies get 9/10, 8,5/10, 7/10, 8,5/10.
3. Eurotrip (2004): After a rough break-up (Scotty doesn't know!) Scotty and Cooper head to Europe to meet up with a sexy German exchange student. They are taken through gags in each country. They party with British hooligans, fight a mime in Paris, experience absinth in Eastern Europe, VanderseXXX in Amsterdam, go to a nude beach and meet the pope in the Vatican City. So much fun and quotable 10/10.
4. Superbad (2007): An updated version of American Pie. Sex-crazed geeky teens want to get laid at a party. Jonah Hill is an unstoppable dick-drawing savage, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the legendary McLovin', trying to score alcohol with a fake id, and Michael Cera is your normal kinda guy. So much fun and so many roughy joke and puking. A classic 10/10.
5. Sex Drive (2008): A teen makes a fake dating profile online, and goes on a roadtrip with his best geeky and charming friend to meet a girl. They encounter sarcastic Armish, swingers, and criminals, all while getting hunted by his gay-hating brother. It is fun, but avoid the unrated version, as it kinda ruins the movie. 7,5/10
6. Good Boys (2019): A bunch of 6th graders want to learn how to kid,  before their first kissing party. It is fun to see how kids this age want to be older and cool, while know knowing what they are talking about! They try to spy on teen girls with a drone, they encounter sex toys, a frat party and much more. It is both innocent and raunchy. 7,5/10a 
7. No Hard Feelings (2023): It is much easier to get cancelled these days, and this movie did get in trouble. So a 30+ female about to lose her house gets hired by some right parents to hook up with a teen to get him out of his shell (this is what almost got it cancelled). So Jennifer Lawrence tries to seduce the kid in various ways, and it goes wrong all the time, like when she in the naked has to beat up a bunch of kids! Still a cute, colorful and fun movie! 8/10.
8. Incoming (2024): Basically a new but slightly more safe take on Superbad, but still pretty fun. We have our four freshmen preparing for their first party. One would rather play video games than go to parties, one is the over-prepared guy who has an elaborate plan involving a surveillance system to seduce women, and then we have our average guy to identify with. The usual gags of drinking, being a fish out of water, innocense and all that. Still fun, 7/10.

I also quite enjoyed The Hangover, 21 Jump Street, Bridesmaids, Hot Tube Time Machine and the Harold and Kumar movies.",Ebbemonster,1h8zx7a,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8zx7a/the_best_rrated_comedies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8zx7a/the_best_rrated_comedies/,2024-12-07 19:19:12,0,0.44,0,0,25,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Review,self,t3_1h8zx7a

It seemed to disappear pretty quickly, fading into movie oblivion before finally being appreciated once again. The gothic horror vibe and cool soundtrack were a winner to-then 16year old me and seeing Snoop as a kind of anti-villain was fresh and in contrast to his rap/gang affiliations portrayed in the media.

Are there movies that take on a broader or more impactful meaning if you’ve been around to watch them unfold across time?

Or Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049—two films that are in conversation with each other, with each reflecting the fears and aesthetics of their own times but creating a larger message about humanity and technology when viewed together.

movies,I freaking LOVE The Family Stone and do every Christmas. ,"I don’t really understand why, but this movie hits me directly in my happy place. It doesn’t have the greatest reviews, which is a mystery to me, because even if it’s not perfect, it’s got incredible casting, solid plot points, pathos, belly laughs, and mothertucking Luke Wilson. 

First of all, Sarah Jessica Parker plays the neurotic outsider to a T. Birdy, defensive, repressed, insecure, but good deep down, even the cringe fest dinner scene lands because of master performances by her, Craig T, and Diane. There is no way to resist Rachel McAdam’s charms, and she’s in full effect here. Even the tragic subplot works, and the epilogue has me sobbing every year.

movies,Listing hidden heroes,"Can anyone list other hidden heroes in movies please, please read description

Hey everyone, I’m trying to collect a bunch of scenes from random movies with essentially side characters which save or try to save people or fight off villains and die or get knocked out in the process. A realistic, good depiction of someone. They don’t have to be in it for long(the lesser the better, it’s meant to be “red shirts” who surprisingly put up a decent fight) If you know any like these please let me know, you might think watch any action movie but literally there are so few with any good depiction let alone other genres.
Some examples(non-exhaustive) are below:
The Living Daylights: MI6 agent Green Four(disguised as a butler) fights Necros in a long creative fight and he even manages to burn Necros’s hand, but is eventually knocked out
The call- a guy at a gas station is killed trying to save the woman and a guy is killed after calling 911

Alone- An old guy fights off a young guy for ages in order to protect a woman and gets killed
See for me- A policewoman radioes for backup, cuffs one of the guys, shoots another, struggles vigorously with another before being killed. 
Turbulence-One of the air martiales fights off a henchman for a long time before being killed
Along came a spider- A fisherman tries to save the girl in the water but is killed
Jaws 2- Heli Pilot(which of no fault of his own but the fault of the script has no one like Brody or the kids tells him there’s a shark so he doesn’t take precautions but tries to save the kids) and Marge(who saves Sean)

Jaws 3- Fitzroyce shoots the shark, tries to swim back up but is caught in the shark’s mouth. He then tries to get out and can’t so he tries to blow himself up with the shark but can’t pull the pin because he’s crushed. This grenade is used in the finale.
Skyfall- Court police shoot loads of times at henchmen and one of the officers kills one of the henchmen off screen and another officer gets shot and keeps shooting
Die hard 3- vault guard calls for backup, fires loads of shots and is brave but is killed
Totally Killer- The mother fights the killer amazingly before being killed
Octopussy-The agent disguised as a clown puts up a good fight and runs for his life and completes his mission before collapsing dead
Hitmans bodyguard- convoy scene is great it’s pretty equal on both sides

Bad examples:
Air Force one- there are so many officers compared to henchmen and they kill ZERO I repeat ZERO henchmen despite being presidential security
Malignant- omg the police station scene has so many officers who run to the killer before shooting……..
Salt- Same issue, there’s some army head who rushes the bad agent before getting his gun out…
Die hard- pick any movie, I’ll give it the minimal credit for having one henchman be killed by the swat team but omg that’s awful
Mission impossible-convoy dream sequence where like 30 cops are killed and 2 henchmen
Turbulence- the last air martial to die literally doesn’t fire when he could while other martial is fighting the henchman",KianAndFamily,1h917do,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h917do/listing_hidden_heroes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h917do/listing_hidden_heroes/,2024-12-07 20:17:34,0,0.4,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h917do
movies,A lot of people think Batman (1989) was the first dark comic book movie. I think an argument can be made that popeye (1980) really was the first.,"Sorry in advance if this take is 2 edgy 4 U. 

Batman clearly made the blueprint for a blockbuster dark super hero movie but in many ways it followed in the footsteps of Popeye. When execs were putting together a Popeye movie they asked Oscar winning comic artist Tony award winning play write, Jules Fieffer, to direct the movie. He pitched them a dark movie based on the dark comic books not the commercially friendly cartoon show. They liked the idea and went with it. This ended up caused what was considered to be a commercial flop.

Today the movie enjoys a better legacy. It has iconic performances from a young robin williams and Shelly Duvall. I think what we forget is the fact that the reason it was a failure isn’t was based on the dark comics not the cheerful cartoon show. This was exactly the angle tim Burton did with Batman leading to massive commercial success.

Today Popeye is a bit of a cult film but i don’t think it gets the credit it deserves for being both old school and ahead of its time.",Potential-Ant-6320,1h9baqz,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9baqz/a_lot_of_people_think_batman_1989_was_the_first/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h9baqz/a_lot_of_people_think_batman_1989_was_the_first/,2024-12-08 04:56:12,0,0.3,0,0,13,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h9baqz

Every side character's nicknames from the Jets is related to their personality contrary to the Sharks that stay rather stereotypical with Latino names, so I'll focus on them : there's Ice (that keeps his cool just like in the song), Action (very energetic all along, ready to fight), even Anybody (pretty early gender questionned character who doesnt belong and have their ways in and out of the shadows) but what about A-Rab ? 

English is not my first language so maybe I am missing a pun, consdering we learn from the police officer his father is an alcoholic ?

movies,What if Marlon Brando was in The Great Gatsby (1974)?,"What if Marlon Brando was in the 1974 adaptation of The Great Gatsby?

This is an interesting story, Robert Evans, who was involved with this production, sought Marlon Brando for the role. Although Marlon Brando was too old for the part, at 49, Evans wanted him in large part due to The Godfather &amp; Last Tango In Paris reestablishing him as a box office star.

Incensed at his loss of income when he surrendered his profit participation points for $100,000 to Paramount before the release of *The Godfather*, Brando personally negotiated his deal, demanding an unprecedented salary reportedly as high as $4 million salary (I think for both Great Gatsby &amp; Godfather II), frankly revealing that the high salary would recoup his losses from the sale of his points.

However, Gulf + Western CEO Charles Bludhorn, whose conglomerate owned Paramount, vetoed any such deal on the grounds that the two movies were separate entities. As a result, Brando turned down The Great Gatsby and also refused to appear in Godfather II, feeling he was being disrespected.

I think Brando would of been interesting, though too old, but I find interesting not doing this film actually resulted in him not doing his cameo in Godfather II. Ultimately, I think the film would of been the same as From what I read, the director, Jack Clayton, pretty much ignore the nuances of the script that was written.

movies,I really miss natural dialogue in animated movies,"This is something I’ve noticed for years—ever since I was a kid watching these movies in theaters—and lately, I’ve been hyperfixating on it because I feel like no one ever talks about it. I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

In movies like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Shrek, Madagascar, El Dorado, etc., the dialogue feels semi-realistic. The characters sound like they’re having genuine conversations, the kind of exchanges you could imagine real people having. It feels natural, almost as if some of it were improvised. It’s as though the writers treated these films as legitimate storytelling, not just “animated kids’ movies.” They gave the characters real depth and personality rather than relying on the gimmick of “silly talking animals.”

This approach wasn’t exclusive to Pixar and DreamWorks either. Movies like Surf’s Up, Ice Age, Rango, Happy Feet, and Coraline had a similar feel. I think what really made it work were the performances—both the writing and the voice acting elevated the characters.

It seems like this style of writing started fading around the time Illumination became popular, which I find really sad. That said, there are some recent examples that capture this feeling, like Klaus, the Spider-Verse films, and Soul. It’s not entirely gone. You also see it in many adult animated shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, and even in a lot of video games.

It’s hard for me to put into words, but does anyone else know what I’m talking about? Is there a name for this style of writing or dialogue?",Ling_B,1h994xw,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h994xw/i_really_miss_natural_dialogue_in_animated_movies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h994xw/i_really_miss_natural_dialogue_in_animated_movies/,2024-12-08 02:51:22,0,0.38,0,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h994xw

movies,Babygirl full review ,"Babygirl: 

electric, hot and sexy, pulse racing, arousing, erotically thrilling, submissively wicked. Nicole Kidman in her best performance of recent memory. 

Babygirl is exactly what it promised to be… an erotic and powerful story of forbidden pleasure. The director Halina Reijn does a super job here in her style of directing and her script writing skills. The tension is felt as if an explosion good go off at any second. A very underrated part of the movie is the cinematography, visually this film is nothing short of stunning,. A shout out to the editors too who have done a brilliant job here. The story as a whole has depth and intrigue that’ll keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat. 

Now on to Nicole Kidman. I said at the start of this review that this is her best performance of recent memory, and I stand by that. The way she portrays the coldness of her character as well as the open vulnerability is perfectly balanced. Harris Dickinson also completely shows again how good he is in anything he does, his control over Nicole Kidman’s character is mesmerizing and intense. Antonio Banderas has more to do in this movie than I initially expected him to have, especially towards the end where he has to dig deep into his emotional range. 

With all that said I understand Babygirl will not be for everyone. Whilst it’s tasteful and respectful in its eroticism, it can be awkward and uncomfortable to sit through for some audiences. 

Finally I just want to give a minor grievance I have which is the story at times can feel clouded where it leaves you the viewer to puzzle together some motives. Apart from that a very solid movie with excellent performances. 

Babygirl = 7/10

movies,Why do Tyler Perry movies look so cheap when they mostly aren’t?,"This is something I have noticed. The thing with Tyler is he started off as a play writer and never really got out of it. He is a play writer first and the movies are basically a lot of his plays put in movies at random. 

I don’t understand how he owns the bigger studio, so big people can live there not just him. Yet, still look cheap. 

My theory is, from what I have seen, all the buildings on base are also used for set designs. All the building designs are similar so it doesn’t look like a town. It just looks like a filming base. 

Maybe that’s not the reason but he does have a lot of money and I just wonder how he unintentionally makes his movies look cheap.

movies,"Question about The last Duel, specifically chapter 2 (for those who have seen it) (spoilers)","The movie has 3 different prespectives. Thier truth according to their testimony in court.

Why does Le Gris's truth &gt;!include the rape of margaret?!&lt; I mean, in his testimony he said he never bed with her regardless, while &gt;!the movie shows him raping her, but in his mind (since its his ""view""), not opposing ""actual"" resitance!&lt;

That is inchoerent to what his testimony is.  In corut not only he denied rape, he also denied being carnal with her in general.

I know he could lie, but the point of the movie was to show what happened according to each testimony, so the movie should have shown just him reciving the news of the accusations, since that's his ""truth""

movies,Thoughts on Flow (2024)?,"Just watched this beautiful (although poorly rendered) animation without dialogues and filled with emotion. It's very good, I loved it! But it is also a deep movie, that lefts you thinking about some of its aspects.

Spoilers ahead:

What do you think that scene where the cat and the bird are raptured to Heaven? 

My thought is: the entire movie is a retelling of the biblical flood and that scene shows that the bird fulfilled his journey and was then, raptured. But the cat still had a mission to do. The fish at the end seems to be ready to be raptured, but since he was an animal of the water he couldn't get to the sacred place to be raptured and then died on earth. At the end, the cat has his entire live to live, he wasn't raptured but he was spared of all the suffering.",fiilisboa,1h8rhod,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8rhod/thoughts_on_flow_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8rhod/thoughts_on_flow_2024/,2024-12-07 12:30:19,0,0.4,0,0,15,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8rhod

**#50. Polite Society** \- This year seems to be the year of over the top teen movies with Red White &amp; Royal Blue, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, and Totally Killer all going viral in spite of let’s say inconsistent quality. We'll talk about another one layer one, but I wanna start with a film that deserves a lot more attention that it got. What you’d get if Robert Rodriguez made a coming-of-age movie, it's a film that embraces its blend of martial arts flicks, over the top family melodrama, and 2000s comedy to a delightful degree. I will admit it's a bit of a case of style overcompensating for a lackluster story but what makes it work overall is the charming relationship of the sisters. Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya have great chemistry with each other, creating a sweet and charming bond throughout the film. At the same time, I also dug it doesn’t shy away from focusing on the immaturity and insecurity of a younger sister selfishly not wanting to lose a best friend to her sister. It does capture that betrayal when a family or friend you thought would be there forever for you has their own aspirations. If there is a nitpick, it's that I wish the actual fight scenes had stronger and more exhilarating choreography. Not that it’s bad per say and it does make sense that a film about an action film fan wouldn’t be as polished as the martial arts films it's paying tribute to. I still would’ve like more memorable fights is all. Still the charming presentation and the comedy more than makes up for it, and I can see this becoming a cult classic amongst teens down the line. 

**#49. Unrest** \- I normally advise people to go on as blind as possible knowing little about the premise. But for this film, I think it is important to know that the entire film revolves around community anarchists working in a watch factory who are secretly plotting a rebellion. It might sound exciting but there's very little drama within the film. There's barely what you could charitably call a story and not even a plot. It's very much a grounded and straight look at how revolution is formed, with no big setpieces and few twists outside of certain workers being arrested. And yet it remains an engaging watch throughout thanks to as the says, a feeling of unrest throughout. There's a sense of simmering anger that you can feel below each scene of workers conspiring in secrecy or even as they continue diligently working for the factory. Everything is below the surface and the power of this film is very much in what is not said, in every careful and deliberate word choice uttered through thin poker faces. The sound of ticking of clocks is a constant soundtrack through the film, almost as if counting down how long the workers have until they're caught. Maybe even how long it may be even viable to accomplish a proper revolution before the window shuts forever. Or perhaps, it's a sign of how time will go on regardless of what process is or isn't made. Maybe despite the stopwatch being built, we actually still have time. Its abstract nature means this isn't for everyone but if you're intrigued about the premise and are willingly to be challenged, can't recommend this enough. 

**#48. The Deepest Breath** \- A lot of people have compared this documentary to Free Solo which is unsurprising considering both are about extreme sports and the people who find meaning and purpose in life in accomplishing the awe inspiring. And even if this film isn't as good as that documentary, this one still stands on its own as a damn good watch. From the gorgeous cinematography to the literally breathtaking footage captured of various free divers, showcasing the determination and tenacity of the divers who do this regular serving and the backdrop of the story of two people who find each other at the right place but debatably the wrong time, it's a captivating watch as we see both the limits of human accomplishment in physical feats and the love that inspires us to keep moving forward. And it'll have you hooked and holding your own breath right up to the conclusion. 

**#47. Take Care of Maya** \- I tend to not care for a lot of Netflix-produced crime documentaries. A lot of them tend to be cheaply produced and overly dramatic, not to mention often with surface level commentary and analysis. It tends to put a damper on what could be interesting stories and neuters them in favor of sensationalization. Thankfully, this documentary is not only an engaging watch but one that does proper justice towards a wronged family and highlights a corrupt medicare system that harms rather than heals. Focusing on a young girl with a rare disease and the hospital that intentionally misunderstood her case to take advantage of her family, it is a tough and heartbreaking film. It highlights not just the cruelty in corporate healthcare on not just those who need it but the emotional toll on the families, but also one of inspiration. No matter how powerless their fight may be and how they acknowledge very real risk that even standing up will only result in more pain and trauma, it's moving see the love parents have for their children and an inspiring story of courage and tenacity of a family who fought together and never gave up in spite of everything being against them. It’s a quick but emotional watch that I hope more people do more than scroll past when they go on Netflix.

**#46. Infinity Pool** \- There are films that are depressing watches for their subject matter and tone, and then there are films that are out to make you uncomfortable. Not in the sense of making you feel danger is around any corner, more poking and prodding at the limits your desires will take you. Lust, sexual satisfaction, violence, all of these desires are ones we normally tempered. Infinity Pool asks: “what would happen if you didn't have to filter these sinful, carnal desires?” How far deep would these take you that you go numb from how disgusting you think of yourself and accept it as being blasé? I fully accept this may be me overthinking this movie and being off from its themes. Regardless of my interpretation of this film though, I can deny how. From being disgusted from being intrigued and fascinated, it's a pool I dove in feet first and will continue treading its waters for the next couple of years. 

**#45. The Sweet East** \- This is a movie most will probably hate after finishing and to be honest, as I was watching it for the first time, I did find it incredibly obnoxious. It's full of insufferable, pretentious, and frequently unlikable characters, the narrative makes little sense with Talia Ryder barely reacting to anything or having any change, and by the end you think what was actually accomplished? What did we gain and what was learned? And yet much like Infinity Pool, it's that absurdity that I kept on my mind over the next few days. I kept thinking about Talia-s blasé attitude to the whole adventure - encountering blatant racism, insecure men, and snobby artists and how in a way, it actually did speak to a certain zeitgeist. And as much as I was annoyed by the film, it also kept me engaged and by the end the bitter taste actually made sense. I can't say you will enjoy this film or get as much as I did but it is a film I doubt you'll forget once the credits roll. 

**#44. The Holdovers** \- Some films sneak up on you. At first I wasn't in love with this film as everyone else was. While I thought it was good, it felt a bit too slow and felt like I'd be better served watching any of the 80s classics like Dead Poets Society and Planes Trains and Automobiles that served as inspiration for this film. And yet like the train scene in PTA, I found myself thinking more and more about my experience and realizing how warm it was and how much I took for granted. The chemistry between all three leads, not just from the award winning performances from DaVine Joy Randolph and Paul Giamatti, but also from newcomer Dominic Sessa who I think has gone criminal underappreciated. He proves himself to be a young actor full of charisma, and it's wonderful seeing the relationships the trio has with each other grow without feeling too saccharine. The gradual acceptance all three have in their places as castaways and still finding solidarity in all that is quite moving. Even if it's a predictable formula of the classic grump learning to have a heart, Alexander Payne manages to make these characters feel human and real. It's already a Christmas classic and I could easily see a lot of families having this on as a new annual tradition. 

**#43. Sanctuary** \- Power is sexy and being sexy gives power. It’s an alluring power dynamic and this film manages to make simple discussions and dialogue of it not feel drawn out for 90 minutes. For a film of almost zero nudity and zero sex scenes, this has some of the tightest sexual tension in any romantic film in a while. Both Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley deliver fantastic, layered performances, showcasing why they're some of the most interesting young actors right now. The cat and mouse game they play going back and forth at each other is endlessly entertaining as you wonder who's in control and who's really being played. Which one submits first? Even with the play-like structure and the bottleneck setting, this had me captivated for its 90 minute runtime. I really hope more people check it out and I hope both Qualley and Abbott continue to get attention for their work, and I'm already eagerly anticipating Zachary Wigon’s next film, also starring Qualley. 

**#42. Killers of the Flower Moon** \- If this had been 30 minutes shorter and had Mollie given more development beyond simply being the symbol of Native purity and beauty literally poisoned by the white man, I imagine this would've been much higher. Because simply on a film level, it is one of the most impressive and epic in scale. From the pacing and editing that manages to keep the three and a half hour runtime engaging despite of lull points, to the grand production and setpieces that capture how big of a plot this is, to the tight cinematography capturing it all, to the roster of a cast that has even cameo roles shine to an ending that probably one of the more daring statements Scorsese has ever made about America and its dark history. It is a behemoth worth marveling at and even though it doesn't resonate as much as I would want to, I can't deny it's more than deserving of all the acclaim it's gotten. It is a great movie that I just wish I was able to connect emotionally more with as everyone else has. 

**#41. Earth Mama** \- Being a parent is a difficult task and even more tragic are the women desperate to be a mother despite society not allowing them to be or looking down upon them for doing so. But what about the women who, controversially, ‘aren’t fit’ to be a mother? Who is really deserving of that title? That’s the tough question that Savannah Leaf’s heartbreaking debut seeks to answer: what if a woman isn’t suitable to raise her own child. In less empathetic hands, this may have been too heavy or not a balanced portrait, but Leaf’s sensitive direction allows us to come to our own conclusions while not shying away from the dirty truth surrounding it all. But the power of the film lies in Tia Nomore’s lead performance as the imperfect woman wanting to be a mother. She's able to capture the motherly instincts and drive that would make her a good, maybe even great loving parent. Yet it doesn’t shy away from how naively blind she is to her selfishness and commitment issues that would complicate things for her and potentially traumatize her baby. And what’s most intelligent is how both sides are ones you understand the causes behind even if they seem counterproductive. You want her to achieve her goals of raising a family yet at the same time you want someone to step in to guide her away from a potentially toxic and self-destructive household. It's a film with an honest maturity, culminating in an ending that is tragic but at the same time earned. This went a bit under the radar but even with the heavy tone and subject matter, I hope more check it out.

**#40. Talk to Me** \- Another year, another A24 horror movie that’s gone viral and lives up to the hype. Although in contrast to some of their disturbing but challenging and difficult movies, Talk to Me is one of their most straightforward horror flicks. That's not to say Talk to Me is less than though, it still has that great suspense and atmosphere even with the localized Australian teen setting. Despite the stoner archetypes of the cast, what this film has to say about depression, trauma, suicidation and its effects on the family don't just hit home, but feel scarier than any possession or gore the film could’ve conjured up. Couple that with teen actors that have great chemistry with each other while acting like bratty, immature kids, and some of the best gore and makeup effects that'll have you squirming in your seat, and you've got not just another good addition to A24’ horror catalog but a promising breakthrough for the Philippou Brothers who I’ll no doubt be following for their future p projects.

**#39. How to Blow Up a Pipeline** \- This'll no doubt be one of the most controversial movies I praise on this list, especially if you are immediately against the premise and what the Andrew Malm Manifesto that inspired this movie advocates. But whatever your views are about the acts committed in this film, this is one of the best and most tense heist films in a while. It's not a film asking you to agree with the act nor is it necessarily concerned about changing your mind. Frankly it could care less if you would snitch on it. Whether you want to or not, you'll have to follow the shoes of those actually willing to do the extreme, how they pull it off, and the grit they have to stand by their acts. And yet it's also not a film loudly saying why this should be done, as it doesn't shy away not just from the consequences but the lackluster success rate in creating change that acts like this. At its core though, it's a tight and tense film with a fantastic editing and pacing as you get sucked into whether or not they'll accomplish their task, and by the end a film that dares you to wonder whether they should've gone farther or pulled back. 

**#38. Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie** \- Michael J. Fox has been one of the most inspiring figures for me. While it captures his struggles with Parkinsons and the humor he maintains despite his troubles, what I love however is the narration which was taken from his autobiography. It shows how self-aware and reflective he was about just upbringing, success, and shame regarding his addictions yet also how much wisdom he still has even as the disease continues to spread. Whether or not you're a fan of his work, just know him from his biggest movies, or just know him as the Back to the Future kid, I still highly recommend this film as a shining beacon of true human fearlessness. 

**#37. Scrapper** \- For as heavy, deep, and complex films are on this list, sometimes you just need a film that's just so charming and cute. I was actually hesitant to watch this film, writing it off as something I might find too twee and cutesy. But by the first 15 minutes I was hooked in. Much of that due to how damn charismatic the central girl is Lola Campbell, in one of the best child performances of 2023. I love the juxtaposition with both them being young people forced to grow up and act like adults, Lola, the scrappy child left to fend for herself and Harris the immature manchild realizing he actually needs to mature if he’s to salvage anything from his past relationship. And while there is an exaggerated tone, particularly in the editing, neither feel like simple characters; she is not simply a wise ass smart beyond her age and he's not simply a bumbling idiot trying to be a parent. They're both trying to figure out and realize they can't be alone in surviving anymore, and no matter how much they fight there is a familial chemistry between them that they need to keep hold off. It's short and sweet, a comfortable family comedy that shows even simple, played out concepts can be an emotional ride. 

**#36. No One Will Save You** \- It's easy for straight-to-streaming horror releases to get a bad wrap as cheaply made scare fodder. Which is why one of my favorite surprises of the year came from a quietly promoted release on Hulu that probably should've been released in theaters. The big talking point for this film is the decision to have virtually no dialogue throughout. In a lesser film. This could've been a cheap gimmick for a rote house invasion story through aliens. Instead, thanks to smart pacing, writing, and a committed performance from Kaitlin Dever, it turns the film into one of the more creative horror films of last year. The lack of dialogue alongside the great sound design manages to capture, it's an engaging character study in Grief, guilt, and self-alienation. Everything feels elevated with the lack of dialogue and trust you to understand what's going on. It's also a film that invites multiple viewings as there were background details about Dever's character and her story I didn't notice on first viewing. Sure the designs and the effects on the aliens might be a little cheap but that doesn’t take away from how engrossing an experience this was. I really hope this grows a cult following and escapes the trapping it got by being relegated to streaming, we could really use more innovation amongst mainstream horror. 

**#35. Skinamarink** \- This is a film that people either find terrifying or absolutely boring, with very little in between. There's no getting around how 97% of this film is still shorts of walls, hallways, ceilings, and other rooms with a hazy nocturnal filter and with the camera intentionally positioned away or obscuring…anything. If you aren't sucked into the first 2 minutes of this film, you are likely to feel miserable and irritated by the next hour and a half. And i'll admit I was skeptical I would fall for this filma spell, yet, I was enthralled throughout by the atmosphere. There is a film that for me captures a sense of helplessness and claustrophobia as a child in the dark, knowledgeable in little besides your own uncomfortability and fear. Your paranoia as you sit or lie down pondering the thought of monsters under your bed or in your closet may sound juvenile but this film shows that that fear may never go away, sometimes it's just hidden behind your view. Again, I can't guarantee you'll like this film and I also do understand people who think this could've been a short analog horror film. But I couldn't help but be drowned in this films atmosphere and few films had that experience with me. 

**#34. Trenque Lauquen** \- Sometimes, a film can escape a cheap, low budget look not through quick editing or quick banter, but through simple engaging writing and charismatic performance. This film can be daunting being a four hour watch split into two parts and truthfully not that many action or tension driven sequences, not to mention actually hard to find a copy of to watch. And yet I was just as drawn in by the central mystery that I couldn’t help but join along for the ride as you piece together clues behind a potentially large conspiracy. And central to the film's success is the lead performance by Laura Paredes, who not only captures Laura’s curiosity and desire for adventure, but possesses a subtle but magnetic charisma that would make you want to follow her. She doesn’t know where she’s going or what she’ll even do with the discovery once she arrives at it but you can also sense a determination to find what she’s looking for. Paredes doesn’t play it off as aimless soul-searching but as a woman on a mission perhaps only she can understand. Now I will say this is lower than I would want because the second half doesn't quite keep up the pacing of the first, and meanders a bit too much for me. Still the lead performance and the first act's tight writing still come with a recommendation for me. It might not be a satisfying destination by the end but it's the journey that's the more rewarding bit. 

**#33. Bottoms** \- It’d be so easy for me to call this the Superbad for Gen Alpha gays as it is a crass, crude and immature comedy and like with Superbad, it could’ve easily fallen into the trap of relying too much on vulgarity and innuendo. But in fact there's a lot more to Bottoms than just adopting modern slang to appeal to a younger audience. From the great supporting performances (particularly Kaia Gerber and Ruby Cruz) who are game for making this as fantastical and absurd as possible to the chemistry throughout that actually makes their relationships and interactions endearing and even blunts some of the more obnoxious characteristics of the main leads. The clever visual gags, to the quick pace and editing which means jokes don't overstay their welcome, even the slang doesn't feel too obnoxious as to instantly date this movie. It's just a really charming comedy that will no doubt become a cornerstone movie for teens this decade, every generation deserves a crass Crude comedy to rally behind and this one is smart enough to transcend that age barrier. 

**#32. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** \- It's a real shame that the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies come out as the hype and interest for the brand fades and as Paramount is going through financial instability. But it’s a testament to the films quality that even with waning interest in the Turtles brand, word of mouth meant this was able to find an audience amongst old fans, critics, and even create a new generation of fans. There’s honestly so much to praise but more than the catchy synth score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosa of all people, more the gorgeous handrail animation bringing it back to the comic book roots, and more the colorful cast of villains that are really funny and well voiced (including an Ice Cube performance that doesn’t just feel like every Ice Cube performance), what makes this film are the Turtles themselves. It was a great decision to actually have them as teenagers for once and the writing and the voice cast makes them so lovable. Out of all the other adaptations I've seen, the turtles here don’t just feel like teenagers but actually feel like four brothers. They’re loose and fun, immature but not like every other quippy superhero team we’ve gotten since Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, they still throw in their signature personality traits so as to not make everyone feel interchangeable. Most of all they’re relatable and kids you root for - like with Bottoms, the Gen Z slang and social media humor doesn't feel like it dates this movie because of the smart writing and the chemistry between everyone. Paramount has said they'll continue with this direction for the Turtles and I really hope we do get a feature sequel for this crew because this is the type of imagination and creativity we need in children’s media.

**#31. The Killer** \- It takes a special kind of balls for a director to make a film that's a giant middle finger to an audience that latched onto his films for the wrong reasons. A darkly comedic deconstruction of the typically stoic, masculine killer as someone just as clunky, pathetic, and weak as the “normies” he looks down upon, it's an even more impressive thing this doesn’t feel like a self indulgent mess. Fortunately, David Fincher is one of the few directors who can pull it off and make an engaging thriller regardless of whether you see the subtext or not, because amazingly it still works as a straightforward action film. The action and choreography is tight and controlled but gritty - with the break-in fight being one of my favorite fight scenes of last year, the editing creates a sense of tension while also interjecting black humor so as to not get bogged down in self-serious parody, and Michael Fassbender captures the fake macho posturing of a man realizing he isn't the invincible or even intelligent Assassin he clearly wants to be. This film has been a bit divisive even for Fincher fans but I really hope there is a reinterpretation for this film later on as even if it's not subtle per say, it still is an engaging subversion of masculine tropes. 



**#30. A Thousand and One** \- Sometimes a film's power and emotions can overcome some story and presentation flaws. This is not a flawless film by any means as it does have issues in regards to narrative and presentation. But the sheer blunt emotions it holds overpowers any issues I might have to being one of the most gripping family dramas of last year. And that comes from the Trio of actors with William Catlet and Josiah Cross also wonderful. Both are great with Cross being the eldest version of Terrie, the confused child unsure of where to go in life and whether he's getting the support from the family he'd like, and Catlet as the reluctant father who still nonetheless gives it his all to be the father Terrie needs. But it’s Teyana Taylor who delivers one of the best and most powerful performances in all of 2023. She is an absolute star here and in a just world, she'd have been recognized for this film and given so many calls by directors looking to cast her. Like with Earth Mama, it doesn't shy away from the difficulty of being a mother - both society driven and by her own personal hang ups. Yet it is more than just the template of a hardworking mother struggling to keep her family together and above water that we’ve seen in other movies. Taylor disappears in her role of unwavering love, courage and ferocity shown to fight for her family that feels so raw and real. It's not the unique take on this story and it isn't an easy watch, but the performances alone make this an unforgettable experience and I really hope all three actors can get more exposure and bigger roles from this. 

**#29. 20,000 Species of Bees** \- Children have their own dignity that deserves to be acknowledged and most of all respected. It's a concept that seems absurd and a hard pill to swallow for most people and yet this movie shows why it’s important to respect it. Looking at the journey of a trans child no older than 10, from her own self acceptance to the reactions from her mother and the grandmother she's visiting, what really drew me in is that the film doesn't sugarcoat or infantilize the audience with how difficult it can be for her family to accept it. Her older relatives are more the well meaning types more prone to tolerance than accepting and even dismissing her at times. And yet they, and in particular her caring and loving grandmother, are still the ones giving her the support she needs to not just accept who she is but love herself. I also think it's clever how this struggle is reflected in the relationship between the mother and her parents. How the lack of reciprocity from her mother and especially her father, may have contributed to her failing marriage and lacking love she needs to give to her children. It all leads up to an ending that had me stunned on first watch and constantly thinking about it for the next few days. Couple that with Sofia Otero's fantastic performance which rightfully nabbed her a Best Leading Performance award at the Berlin International Film Festival - capturing both her confusion with her domestic situation but also the stubborness to accept her identity when others won't - and you have a small but powerful trans film that’s gone overlooked by far too many. Love is complicated and harder than it, even if its to yourself, but it's better to have love and hone than to have nothing.

**#28. The Eternal Memory** \- Nothing lasts forever and everything will fade in time, no matter how much we try to keep the memories of people and events in tact. It's a tough and scary reality we all have to face even when it seems unfair that goodness can go unrewarded. But choosing to remain loving and kind in the face of that is something that has to come from inside, no matter who remembers it. And the center of this documentary is the love between Augusto Góngora and Paulina Urrutia; a wife caring for her husband slowly losing himself to Alzheimers and yet never leaving his side, still living with him no matter his condition. But it's more than a touching story of marriage as there are three different memories being fought to be preserved. There’s also the memory of the family, who he’s been as a father and husband for many decades. There’s the memory of Góngora’s vital work and accomplishments as a journalist, documenting a Chile in unrest and the resistance that helped turn the tides. And there’s also memory of a Chile whose progress is on the cusp of being reversed amidst a new regime of power. It sounds like a tricky balancing act but this documentary manages not to feel overstuffed because as it reminds us, what keeps us united and focused is love. It’s a beautiful and touching documentary that even if it hits too close for some, I can’t recommend enough if only to keep this memory from dimming too early.

**#27. How to Save a Dead Friend** \- Media often portrays love between addicts as a tragic tale of people unable to save themselves or one of them. It's often easy to criticize them when you're on the outside looking in because logic laughs at the ridiculous stubbornness people show. Yet this documentary defies that by showing us why love is still just as strong and valid even when it seems like an irrational act. That even amidst the political and social unrest of Russia, amidst an uneven and crushing economic structure denying dreams to flourish, and amidst personal demons, genuine romantic love and comfort can still be bright and worth celebrating. This isn't a film that simply ignores from how destructive drugs and addiction can be, rather it shows that relationships and the emotions we shared with each other shouldn't be tossed away even if the situations weren't ideal. Even if it wasn't ever meant to last long, that he was doomed from the start, that the memories shared between them is worth savoring and cherishing. This is an admittedly hard film to track down but if you have the chance, do watch it. It’s an emotional love story and a creative documentary.

**#26. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood** \- And concluding the inadverdent trio of documentaries, we have a small film that packs a big punch, showing sometimes blunt honesty in a closed setting can be more impactful than any big imagery a camera can capture. Some might be uncomfortable at the idea of a documentary of mostly naked women opening up about their experience of trauma, abuse, and hurt, but it's not a film simply wallowing in misery and despair. It can be tough to hear such vulnerable stories, ones that admittedly feel uncomfortable for intruding upon. But the nudity and nakedness actually amplifies their experiences - showing how unafraid they are of opening up - and like the sauna they're in also makes the act of being there one of healing. It's a double cleanse on multiple levels in terms of letting go of pain but also having the support of those ready to listen. The stories will be triggering for some people so I can't easily recommend it to everyone. But for those willing to listen, I hope it can show inner peace can happen and that you don't have to stay hurt forever.",dremolus,1h8mbvs,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8mbvs/top_50_favorite_films_of_2023_5026/,2024-12-07 06:17:22,0,0.44,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Recommendation,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Lv5K4bNzmRq5iVWsmVRjGb8tiX9SND_AhWiu1dV3DXs.jpg,t3_1h8mbvs

movies,Is there any website listing differences between theatrical releases and airplane cuts? And anyone know as to Silent Night (2023)?,"Hello, fine folks of Reddit. 

I am a digital immigrant, not a digital native (I am not quite a Baby Boomer; I’m Generation X, but I identify with the Boomers; that means I’m old). Something I appreciate about the internet, among the many benefits offered by the profound innovation, is that people who are more obsessive than I am perform a service for the world, generally for free, of analyzing subjects I take an interest in, reliably enough for my purposes. For many movies that have multiple versions, you can find a list of the differences between the original theatrical release, and the DVD, and a director’s cut. But I am unaware of any resource listing what has been taken out (or added in, but it likely is taken out rather than added in) to the airplane version of movies.
I appreciate that you usually have a title card about the editing, whether for aspect ratio or content. I write as I stream John Woo’s Silent Night. It warned me. I checked: what I have started is a full five minutes shorter than the unexpurgated runtime. I am wondering if someone has performed the service of examining the one against the other (which might be difficult, since I don’t know how you get the airplane edition other than on the airplane itself, so you’d have the put it on, then also stream it on a device; there would be no demand for a repository of airplane bowdlerizations, presumably; once on the ground, you’d want the full content). If anyone has a sense as to this specific title, please feel free to enlighten me. Presumably, it’s the violence that has been taken out. Given the middling reviews of the original, I’m not dedicated enough a fan to sit through the picture twice.
So to sum up, I have three questions.
(1) Thoughts about the airplane versions of movies?
(2) Is there a website I am unaware of, that enables people to check out what they have missed from perusing an airplane version?
(3) Anyone see Silent Night twice, who can tell me if I have been cheated of the best parts?",FrankW1967,1h8iqzk,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8iqzk/is_there_any_website_listing_differences_between/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h8iqzk/is_there_any_website_listing_differences_between/,2024-12-07 02:45:07,0,0.35,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h8iqzk

movies,Subservience (2024) - Thriller/Sci-fi,"SPOOOOILER   
this is for those who HAVE WATCHED THE FILM AND WANT TO DISCUSS. this is my own take (why I liked it, what would have made it better, etc.)

this isn't ur average: ""robots take over the world and they're bad because..."" story. I mean, yes- from the beginning its giving- proceed with caution but this twist on what could be is fantastic. I was SO excited for this film before even watching it. I will begin with, I love futuristic, end of the world or new world films (and novels.) and I gotta say I love the idea of AI overpowering human kind because as a society we are ABSOLUTELY heading in that direction and surprisingly no one seems to realize this writing is an inference of what will happen if we continue. my overall score is 7/10 read below for my analysis and reasoning. 



my initial opinion of the main character (Nick) is he is smart, handy, nurturing, patient, and so goddamn sexy. hes a pretty complex character imo, he was constantly battling with what is right/ wrong from the beginning.  he works a blue collar job (that can and eventually are replaced by SIMS) and tries his hardest to fight against his friends losing their jobs. but he actively uses extremely advanced technology like his refrigerator, populating bars utilizing SIMS to serve, and ofc hiring his own SIM. he expresses a high sex drive (source: when Maggie (his wife) is literally in the hospital bed waiting for her heart surgery, hes making jokes abt getting her back to the marathons they used to have- but she doesn't seem to mind, shes pressing into him too so we can only assume she has an equally high sex drive too) but remains faithful even when he feels an unintentional attraction to Alice. 

when Nick asked Alice to wipe her memory in order to ""experience"" Casablanca, that's exactly what she did. she consumes the film as if shes a part of it. erasing her program to reprogram the story as her own. she tells Nick that resetting her in order to ""forget"" the memory she has of Casablanca will be antithetical, but he still does it. the quote from the movie we see is ""you are a man. if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?"" then the call is interrupted by a call from Maggie. 

  
the entire film counters being dependent on AI, but very much distinguishing their inability to experience life through emotions. in the beginning scenes, the sales person explains the longer the AI unit is with the family/ the more knowledge it obtains the better it will perform. but no one seems to think they can replicate emotions or make decisions outside of their based programming?   
as soon as she wipes her memory.. she learns only: Nick, Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland. throughout the film we see her putting together the metaphoric similarities of their real life to the characters of Alice in Wonderland when speaking with Isla as well. she even notes wiping her own civility because ""it's better."" aka more human. aka creating a more genuine link to human emotion. (this doesn't make sense to me, because in this film- the companies programming these SIMS are extremely hands on- later in the film the company even immediately takes action in bringing in two employees well after working hours to reset/ reprogram Alice. every story of robots taking over the world seems to always conclude that robots will outsmart the companies who make them. so in a world where we're so far advanced; AI is in your home and consuming more and more information all the time, is it really so crazy to assume the companies who created them would want to check in on their projects' progress? the amount of times we hear how much money they cost, you think they would have scheduled tune ups frequently. with scheduled check ups, the companies would have found out a lot of her program was wiped and I think this fact kind of kept me in movie mode- not so much lose myself in the film mode.)

   
to me, it's obvious the matter of ""messing around"" with Alice wouldn't have ever crossed Nick's mind if she didn't look the way she did. there would have never been a moment where he was willing to risk anything if Alice was ""an old English butler,"" which was originally what Nick and Maggie had originally discussed when purchasing a nanny SIM.   
he gives the explanation that ""Isla chose her,"" and I think this is a really great moment to note: he really was teetering back and forth whether he found it wrong or not. he clearly liked to look but even if the idea crossed his mind- he never tempted himself with any action. it wasn't until Maggie told Alice that if she died, Alice needed her to comfort Nick and make sure he's taken care of. the first time they messed around (in the garage later that night) Alice initiated it. she convinced him she wasn't real (because her heartbeat is just a simulation programmed to provide comfort to humans) and encouraged him to proceed if only for his own health and he does.   
the second time is after the shower when she again, tempts him with lingerie and a blindfold. she disguises herself as Maggie which was such a nice touch because it really enforces the idea that there is nothing human about her and essentially can be or do whatever he needs. and \*\*ok honestly\*\* lets face it the bathroom scene was... nice   ͡° ͜  ͡  
  
BUT I really hate that that's the extent of their relationship. the next morning, Nick ""ends it"" with her, the wife gets her surgery and comes home and then it turns into this weird vibe between the women. all of a sudden, we see a jealous/ competitive side from Maggie (ie: dirty looks when Alice cared for the baby, cattiness towards Alice when she asked for the family recipe, etc.) I dont understand because at this point Maggie has no idea that Alice and Nick have had sex- Alice has only shown she is an obedient and hard-working and loving nanny so idk how the vibes are so far off when there wasnt a single hospital visit that was weird?

here's where the story line goes all over the place. there was SO much build up between Nick and Alice and then for like 6 scenes in a row you don't even see the two of them in conversation. we have the playground scene (where we learn Alice has changed her software to have more of a human approach to casual encounters,) the shower scene between Nick and Maggie (where Alice interrupts with Isla's nightmare,) then we see Monty attack Nick, Alice k\*lling Monty (\*but we also learn that Monty: hater of all SIMS, OWNS A SIM. he's coked out and contemplating suicide but we also learn hes been using and ab\*sing his SIM,) then the bathtub scene between the women (again- would have been a nice time to see Alice be useful to Maggie??? this woman has just had open heart surgery, her medicine has proved two separate times to cause dizziness, and she isn't thankful to have the extra hands on deck. again- up until THIS POINT SPECIFICALLY, she doesnt know Nick and Alice have hooked up. obviously in this scene, she puts it together, but in my perfect world, she would have accepted the help from Alice and welcomed the extra energy she has to take care of her husband- which before she was about to die was her only concern? idk weird continuity there, but again this is the scene she puts together that they've indeed had sex. but then immediately the scene goes from Maggie and Nick talking about his affair to Alice trying to drown the baby. 

??? huh !!! ???   
I have watched this movie now three times all the way through and this just does not add up. her software changes up until this point could always be justified with \~what she was learning real time.\~ she says its bc Max is a ""burden,"" which in the beginning Nick (when Max was crying,) shushes him and says ""quite the little burden,"" but the words are never brought up again and that was BEFORE the hard wipe before Casablanca. so..... yeah I really really dont understand this part.   
not to mention miss ""I just had open heart surgery"" takes on scaling the house and fighting a robot? 

  
I definitely wouldnt have made her turn on the kids- if there was no hope in seeing a harmonious relationship between the women, I would have much rather seen Alice drowning Maggie in the bathtub and played it off as ""people accidentally drown all the time,"" or using her medication symptoms to her own advantage and coerced Maggie into hurting herself or the kids (making Nick question her character, aka not be in love with her.) 

ok so then yada yada, we're at the hospital with the baby to check on his vitals (even though he was never even submerged in the water? kinda dramatic to take him by ambulance to the ER but whatever. flashes to the bar scene where Alice speaks in a revised quote from Casablanca and informs Nick, she k\*lled Monty for him, and will take care of his family (alluding to the fact that she had connections in the hospital at the same moment.) then Nick attempts to trick her (c'mon now.. shes clearly proved she cant die?) and k\*ll her and he races to the hospital. ofc we get this unrealistic fast and furious driving through the snowy streets only to have his car crash into an ambulance pinning Alice in between them. SHOCKER: she still doesnt die. we have to sit through terrible fight sequences and multiple fake deaths before everyone walking away barely scathed. Nick is in a hospital bed with light bruising and Maggie is healing in a wheelchair with both children and she invites him to come home \*rolls eyessssss. the film then ends with a 30 second clip of Alice's software uploading on every SIM and her opening her eyes after reconstruction of her face implying a sequel.... I’m gonna go ahead and say we dont need it. 

tldr;   
my rating would be higher than 7/10 if the company was more hands on, there was more of a relationship (whether that would have been friendship or romantic) built between Nick and Alice, a more manipulative side of Alice towards Maggie, more mentions of Casablanca and Alice in Wonderland (so we could have definitively seen the allusion to the stories playing IRL for Alice,) and heres a big kicker: I really wish that Nick would have died in the car crash. this may be so so over the top controversial, but I think it would have been very \~poetic justice\~ if he died trying to save Maggie when it was his actions that potentially destroyed them in the first place  

  
anyway :) definitely watch the movie!! big fan!!

movies,"""Goofs""","Various websites list film goofs but some of them baffle me, I have just watched The Guns of Navarone and as with any film i like to read the Trivia and Goofs on IMDb and the TV Tropes pages.  
  
 On the mild side there is the usual guff about the wrong tanks and guns being used but the fact that Gregory Peck is an American palying a British person isn't classed as a goof. If an American playing a British person isn't a goof then an American tank pretending to be German isn;t a goof either.  This is mild because yes it's technically a goof and so i'm not too bothered that people are complaining but it's still slightly irrational to complain about it. 

  
On a more irritating note though is bollocks like ""they reused shots"", so what? It's OK to re-use a shot especially if another filmed shot would be almost identical, it's absurd to call it out as a goof. 

For me a slip up/goof/blooper would be a missed or poorly enunciated line, a bumped camera, a crew member in shot, equipment in shot that shouldn't be and other such things. I don't see how a dressed up vehicle pretending to be a different vehicle is any different to an actor dressing up and pretending to be someone they are not.   
  
Should we call out Colin Firth playing King George in The King's Speech a goof? They really should've dug up the actual King George to play the part, it's clearly historically inaccurate to not have the actual King in the part. 

This is of course ridiculous, just as ridiculous as expecting films made many years after a period to have period accurate props, It's much easier to employ actors, whether human or otherwise, and use those instead. 

  
Anyway, what do you think, is using the ""wrong"" vehicles or guns as a ""goof""? Or do you see them playing a role and being something they are not just like the actors are?

movies,Does the mockbuster business model still work? ,"Traditionally, mockbusters were made for foreign markets or were rushed through production to hit TV or video about the time the movie they were knocking off hit theaters. Streaming would seem to massively disrupt this. Theatrical windows are much shorter &amp; popular things usually have instant international distribution. I'm not sure there is a modern equivalent of being in Blockbuster in mid-June of 1993 &amp; the kids are hyped for Jurassic Park, but no way are you paying $40 to take them all to the theater &amp; you could rent Prehysteria! for $2.

Theoretically, this model could make sense for streamers, but most of the streamers are associated with studios &amp; Netflix has shown little interest. They certainly put out relatively cheap movies to hop on popular trends, but Project Power is hardly Fast and Fierce: Death Race. It's not imitating a particular movie or targeting its release date.

movies,"What particularly violent scene from an already violent movie really messed you up, or stuck with you over the years?","Every now and then people talk about gnarly scenes that kind of come out of nowhere (like that one near the end of Bone Tomahawk) but what about scenes from movies that are already violent, but stand out anyway? For example, there's a brief bit in the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours where three dudes in a street get absolutely dismantled by a machine gun firing from the back of a pickup truck. It's quick, only about one second, but it stuck with me for a long time after watching the movie. Something about seeing those guys just fall apart has never really left my mind, even though the whole movie is pretty violent and has plenty of other gut-wrenching scenes. Another one that seems to be permanently implanted in my mind is in Saving Private Ryan, when they are storming the beach and a guy gets his entire face blown away. All that's left is a concave hole. Even in a movie as violent as SPR, that one brief bit has always stuck with me.

movies,Cruising (1980): Reoccurring character ,"Hi everybody - long time reader, first time poster here!

I just saw 1980s Cruising yesterday and it really stuck with me: The intense atmosphere of NYC underground in the late 70s, the rawness of the SM gay community, and the constant ambiguity of the plot and characters.

Also, very interesting performance by Al Pacino, who you can really see evolve in his role, as his character does during the movie.

I know that Friedkin assigned different roles to the same actors to add to the ambiguity of the movie, however I noticed one of them in particular in completely different roles: A slightly older guy with thin mustache and impure skin (played by Joe Spinell):

02:30: plays the cop on the passenger seat who’s wife left him 

27:28: plays a homosexual in the first bar scene with Al Pacino, right after the appearance of killer Stuart Richards

29:32: same role in the first scene with al pacino standing under Bridge in the park

1:33:31: in the scene where they show murdered Ted, he plays the cop again who briefs the chef on the murder

I just thought that was an interesting choice - did anybody else notice this? I guess Friedkin made that decision to add on the ambiguity even more, blurring the lines between the underground community and the NYPD. Or is there more to it?",Lypscher,1h81w8x,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h81w8x/cruising_1980_reoccurring_character/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1h81w8x/cruising_1980_reoccurring_character/,2024-12-06 13:56:41,1,0.57,1,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,Discussion,spoiler,t3_1h81w8x

movies,The Bad Boys 1 soundtrack is weird.,"Rnb and industrial metal do not go well together. I enjoy the movie, I just think the musical choices are stupid. The movie came out when rock music fandom, in the form of alternative rock and heavy metal, were almost on an entirely different planet from from hip hop and rnb fans. Both sides may have listened to one or the other as a secondary genre, but that's about it. And it was mostly rock fans listening rap as a third tier preference after alt rock and metal. And industrial rock/metal and hardcore rap actually blend pretty well together when placed together in the same atmosphere. But contemporary rnb? Sounds odd and forced, especially at a time when rnb was at its most cheesiest, cleanest, commercial and manufactured sound. In what world did most casual music fans listen to both Nine Inch Nails and Jodeci? Those bands may as well have existed in alternate universes.

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Slovenia,"Hello there!

Since more than 40 days, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. Yesterday, we took a look at Slovakia, and even though I haven't seen the winning movie yet - as is so often the case here - I'm pretty sure it will be a worthy entry on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/): ***Obchod na Korze*** (engl.: *The Shop on Main Street*) has not only made it here, but also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965.

Will we have such a high-ranking visitor in the next round, too? Well, we'll see. Our next country is no longer Slovakia, but **Slovenia**, and as everytime before, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

I know that Lou is considered or at least supposed to be the main antagonist for UglyDolls but I now wonder if the Spy Girls were actually the main antagonists of the UglyDolls movie after all. The singers that played those characters (Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX and Lizzo) were billed in the end credits before Nick Jonas' name even showed up.

movies,Gangs of New York revisted,"I watched Gangs of New York tonight. I hadn’t seen this movie since it first came out in the theater 20+ years ago. Aside from a few stunning visual images, I didn’t remember anything about it.

Holy hell, is this movie riveting. It really strikes me as a spiritual counterpart to the Departed. The tension the story builds about an imposter or infiltrator trying not to be discovered keeps you glued to the screen.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to thrive in that role - the infiltrator. Theres something about the  intensity of his eyes and face while taking orders - he listens intently while his body seems to be aching to lunge forward and attack.

Daniel Day Lewis of course is Daniel Day Lewis. Bill the Butcher is one of the great bad guys in cinema. He portrays that character so well that he humanizes the nativist backlash and gives us tremendous empathy. But we also agree he needs to die.

We’ve all heard stories about DDL being very method, getting himself in a character and refusing to break it on set or during the duration of filming, often treating costars and crew members badly in the process. I normally think this kind of process is a bit excessive, but Bill the Butcher makes me think that sometimes, the ends justify the means and that a piece of art so enduring may warrant some temporary suffering.

One of his killings (and you’ll know it when you see it) gave me one of most audible gasps that I’ve ever had watching something. Maybe season 2 episode 1 of House of Cards came close).

The production design is incredible. As a history lover, seeing a pre-automobile major city brought to life is magical. I wish I could step into it and walk among the filthy streets.

If you have never seen this film, or, like me - haven’t seen it in years. Check it out.

How come some movies (those that rely a lot on CGI and built sets) look gorgeous while others look horrendous, but it's not necessarily a case of the bad ones looking that unrealistic?

For example: Dune (both parts), Poor Things, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, MCU pre-Age Of Ultron, etc, all fill me with a sense of wonder and awe, like I could actually go to those worlds and walk around there, while Disney's live-action remakes, Wicked (2024), Wonka (2023), MCU post-Age of Ultron, etc, all look plastic-y and border on uncanny valley.
