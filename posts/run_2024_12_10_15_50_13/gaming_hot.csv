This game is one of the most brilliant games I ever played. And a short one, which I appreciate having now a toddler. 
What a wonderful time to be alive to play such an awesome piece of art. Lucas Pope if you ever read this, I'll pay you a drink, whenever.

I finished this game yesterday night, and it will haunt me for months. It made me live through so many emotions and--weirdly enough--tension.

It is essential to play it without knowing what you get into, to get most of the experience. It is an investigation game. That's all you should know. Which makes it hard to recommend efficiently.

For years I passed over this game as the screenshots on the steam page looks deceptively bland and obscure (strange art direction), with nothing interesting happening in screen. 
Which is a shame, as the art direction once you play works very well, is unique and adds so much to the game. And the screenshots do not spoil anything which is a relief.

For me this game was as marking as Outer Wilds, or Subnautica. Two games with surprising aspects you shouldn't know about prior to playing them.

I wanted to share my excitation and awe with this community.

Along with a PS3 hooked up to play some older exclusives. I've never owned a gaming PC but have played PC games back in the early to mid 2000's. I wasn't really concerned with PC gaming up until I got the Steam Deck and was floored with the how cool and versatile it is. I also have a Steam Deck Dock so I can hook it up to my TV. It does well for what I use it for. But I think I would like to get a gaming PC to play some older games but with much higher resolution and frames. I also was super impressed by Steam sales, people are not lying when they say you can rack up a library for the price of one game on PlayStation or Xbox. I also have both ps plus premium, and xbox game pass ultimate. So I'm not missing any online action when it comes to those systems. But if I could play online for free on PC for most games, that would save me money in the long run. Plus I think I would like to have options ultimately.

gaming,Easy open world games like Mario Odyssey?,"My five year old son loves video games and while I’ve tried a lot of different games with him, he always comes back to his favorite, which is Mario Odyssey. I’ve figured out what elevates it above everything else, which is the open world and yet sandbox design to it while keeping it young child friendly. There’s basically no way to play that game wrong. It’s a true open world sandbox that lets you do anything you want and eventually rewards you progression based on your exploration of the sandbox. There’s a simple story and objective, but the objective is incredibly simple: collect moons.

We’ve tried some other games to varying success, but I’m looking for more options. We are also somewhat system agnostic as I have the means to provide him with different systems.

1. Kirby and the forgotten lands: probably his second favorite. Very youngster friendly. However, it’s not a sandbox and the linear nature frustrated him sometimes (no going backwards, game forces you in a certain direction).

2. Super Mario world 3d and bowser’s fury: the difficulty was a bit too high for 3d world after the first world and suffers the same linear design issue. Bowsers fury was great but ultimately short for him.

3. Animal crossing new horizons: youngster friendly art and design but honestly not in game play. It seems simple, but is heavy on reading and understanding the motivations of progression (paying off your house, earning money, etc.) it also has the issue of not being able to start from scratch and my island is already pretty decked out. He can start his own tent but the island is still the same as my decked out one.

4. Yoshi’s crafted world: great difficulty for kids but again… not open world

5. Captain Toad Tracker: fun bit too difficult as the puzzles get harder

6. Sonic frontiers: way to clunky. He lost interest pretty much right away because of terrible controls.

7. Zelda: breath of the wild: too difficult for him for progression

8. Pokémon: his reading needs to be polished a bit more for him to really get it.

9. Spider-Man: Miles Morales: hilariously is super fun for him to just swing around the city. He even started getting good at fighting, but the puzzles grind him to a halt and then I have to play all those parts.

Anybody have any suggestions that I’ve missed?

gaming,Can someone explain the Indiana Jones hype right now?,"I downloaded it yesterday on my Xbox, and I have to say it’s a pretty mediocre experience for me so far. But the consensus seems to be that it’s going to be GOTY, with people just giving high praise to it.  I feel like I’m missing out on something that’s keeping me from enjoying it. 

My major complaints with this game are that it feels more like an interactive story where I sometimes get to open doors by pressing X and then moving my thumbstick to the left.  When I finally get to see some actual gameplay, it’s mostly stealth. Indiana Jones should be an adventure game, not a stealth game.   Combat when it happens is okay but there’s way better combat in games out there. 

The one thing I do like about combat is there’s lots of options for weapons just lying around that can be easily picked up.  Another thing that’s really the only thing keeping me playing is that the story feels like a real Indiana Jones story, so I keep playing just to find out what happens next. 

Anyway I’m not here to hate on the game, I’m just trying to find out why people love it so much. If I understood that maybe I’d enjoy it more too.

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: my thoughts,"Funny no one is talking about it yet. I play on GFN turning everything up to ""supreme"" (I guess ultra is not good enough anymore). It is a very nice looking game. No expense spared (quoting from another Spielberg movie).

Using the opening scene of the first movie as a tutorial is ingenious. Puzzles and actions are good, but I do not think that is what is going to make or break the game. I am hoping for great set pieces and a good story (which is what the reviews said it has).

I have xbox game pass ultimate, so this is already include in the sub but so far (which admittedly I am not that deep into the game yet) I like it.

I think we need more single player, well written narrative based, AAA adventure games. A very much fresh take from the online service games that become more like a job, or the souls like ""can't-beat-without-practice-for-weeks"" beat-them-ups.

gaming,Silent Hill is Actually More Real Than You Think,"Maybe there isn’t an old abandoned town somewhere full of curses and fog that keeps summoning people to visit and manifest their strongest fears, desires or regrets into physical realities, but for those who does have strong emotions in real life, either self-aware or in their subconsciousness, like something they have experienced in the past that they couldn’t really make peace with deep in, or something that they really fear from happening at the moment, there’s always a Silent Hill in their dream where these subconsciousness would turn into all kinds of mental constructs, not necessarily nightmares but often are, and reminds them of what they have really been trying to escape from in real life, and what they have buried deep down in their mind, often as a self-protection mechanism. 

After playing Silent Hill I have been thinking about many of the dreams that I have from time to time, and many really started to make sense now. It also made me realize that many things that I thought I’ve completely forgotten or let go, actually have much deeper effects on my subconscious then I thought, and realizing it actually helps me to face it better, to actually let go and move on. 

Many horror games are just trying to scare you, but Silent Hill is really trying to teach you how to be brave.

gaming,Multiplayer Teamwork/Minigame Game Recommendations?,"I have grown exhausted of all the ""kill the other people!"" Games. A lot of them are great, well made games. Don't get me wrong. But, I am sick of the sweat. The skill ceilings and the absurd amount of stress they can sometimes bring about instead of joy. I work a full-time job and have fully accepted I will never be on the same level as someone who's either naturally gifted (which I am not), or has the majority of their day to practice (which I do not). So, I ask in hopes that some of you might have some amazing recs!

When I say MP Teamwork, I mean things like Vermintide 2. Deep Rock. Ready or Not. Phasmophobia. The list goes on forever, but I hope you get what I mean. The mission of the game is not ""Kill the other people!"" It is ""All of you are on the same team, working towards the same goal."" Or hell, the examples I listed were just violent (for a lack of a better word) games. Chill games like Party Animals, or other ""minigame"" style experiences are also welcome!

Multiplayer is my favorite type of game to play. I am incredibly anti-social in real life despite wanting social interaction, so it's nice to sit back and play games with other people. It creates this sphere where I am interacting and hanging out with others, but there's really no pressure, and it's a bubble I like to exist in. Thus my preference for it over singleplayer games. But, trying to find games like the ones I'm searching for-outside of the ones I already listed-feels like pulling teeth. I appreciate any recs you might have, or if you just gave this a look over, I appreciate it all the same.

gaming,This New Indy Game Has Led Me To Believe a Good 007 Game May Be Possible,"Put some time into this new Indy game today and I gotta say that they've really nailed the feel of ""being"" Indiana Jones. The game's cleverness and great storyline (so far) have me feel like I'm in the midst of a real Indiana Jones movie, and it's easily the best Indy content of the 2000s. I'm enjoying it so much that it got me thinking of another movie franchise that I have been wishing could return to the glory days..... 007.

  
GoldenEye is obviously considered a high mark of the series and the N64 era, but I, as a fan of the series, even enjoyed the Nightfire, Agent Under Fire and even the terrible multiplayer of Quantum of Solace on the 360. Bond, like Indiana Jones, is a great protagonist/seires that when written well, could have an amazing return to console. While movie licensing has typically meant awful games for the past few decades, this launch is giving me hope that out there is an opportunity to ""be"" James Bond in a well-developed and modern adaptation that I think is sorely missing from our current gaming world. Ideally, if we could see something that grabs a little inspiration from the Hitman games as well, I could die a happy man!

gaming,Why people act like every Xbox game is on PlayStation right now?,"Dont get me wrong guys, i get all the talk and i especially get the doubt (now everything is an ""what if this goes to PS at some point, and i get it)

And i also dont really care about esclusivity at all, im a all platform owner and i would like to own just one lol.

But recently, especially when people ask what console to buy, i've noticed that people tend to say like ""PlayStation since it has Xbox games anyway""

Now, it is true that they've ported some games here and there, and we have some future games confirmed, but as it is now is **far** from having any decente number to say ""all"". 

Just looking at this year, Xbox released 5 fp games (not counting Ara on PC). Of these, only 1 is multiplatform. And is Cod, a game that was always multiplatform. Indiana Jones will be multiplatform but is a 4-6 months exclusive, still i can see the point.

But also looking at next year, out of 6 announced fp games, only 2 are confirmed for PlayStation and yet again they where always multiplatform. Cod and Doom.

I think is kind of dishonest to push people to a console with the promise of playng everything when is clearly not true. You cant play Starfield on PlayStation, you cant play Halo, you cant play Gears, Flight Sim, Age of Mythology, Hellblade 2, Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, Towerborne ecc.

I get that they might get ported in the future, but that's a theory and not a fact.

Anyway, enjoy gaming on all platform!

This false narrative is being abused more than ever by industry leaders. We want to change the direction the industry is heading so that sufficient hardware is not buried for the sake of unnecessary hardware sales and mass consumer manipulation. But we need both gamers and developers more aware of this massive industry oxymoron.""
""Key words:
TAA, Upscaling, Fake Optimization, Blessing or Curse,
Hybred, DLSS, DLAA""


So this video about how most game studios are offloading development costs onto your GPUs and I wanted to spread the word about it.
I'd like to hear from some people about why this could not be true, but specifically from Design oriented background individuals who deal with graphics design. 

TAA in my opinion is the worst looking one and always made my PC lose a ton of frames instead of using fxaa or something but the visual quality and detail games have done according to this video is that extreme TAA is almost necessary due to it being relied on entirely to mask how badly rendered things are. Other than that, the optimization standard is for 30 fps so that is mainly what games apparently are optimization for as a standard in the industry buy mainly if those games are on console. What would the gaming industry projects look and play like if the standard for optimization was at 120 or higher FPS?",Placzkos,1h9luw7,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h9luw7/fake_optimization_in_modern_gaming_and_how_we/,https://youtu.be/lJu_DgCHfx4?si=OknaXDpQtMpEojEr,2024-12-08 15:58:52,0,0.45,0,0,72,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5kHodCQXPcqQsvzOqdjkBGHZXF462rAD86T-WDi53eU.jpg,t3_1h9luw7
gaming,Bring Back Good Co-Op Games,"Marvel Rivals came out. Was pretty cool for like 15 minutes and then I just felt kinda bored and a little sad. 

I’ve been playing games since the 80s and idk, I’m just tired of PvP stuff. Really missing the cooperative games of old.

I remember stuff like Zombies Ate My Neighbors or Left 4 Dead or Gauntlet Legends or Halo or even Destiny or the arcade beat em ups like X-men or the Simpsons or Turtles game when it first came out and these games were just so epic and fostered such great teamwork and camaraderie. Helluva dope feeling and rush having to work together to win. Especially back in the days of arcades, nothing cooler than actually assembling 4 people dedicated to pulling it off.

Idk. Everything just feels so competitive, battle royale, hero shootery, and it’s just beginning to feel unnecessary and kinda forced and stale.

Maybe I’m just feeling nostalgic and outta touch lol but I feel like bringing these kinds of great co-op games back in a modern sense in actual abundance would really inject some love and positive vibes back into the community while also, bringing in a whole new demographic of gamers looking for something less demanding and stressful than PvP gaming which I feel like is just low key bloating the market at this point.

P.S. this is no dig Marvel Rivals or to gamers that enjoy these games, I’m just getting this off my chest lol sorry it’s late, I’m high, rant over.

lol nope just a husband, father, business owner and student. I’ve been playing games since the 80s. I know major titles and indie games exist guys no offense lol. Mostly all the ones that have been named so far are not new names to me or games I haven’t tried at some point that just didn’t capture my interest.

Edit: Idk why I’m getting downvoted so much lmao are you taking offense to the fact that I just don’t like the games you’re suggesting as much as you or others do or haven’t played them? 

Idk I think I’ve been pretty respectful about the games I have talked about, even the ones I may not care for as well but idk. Either way, I’ve played Indie game guys. I’ve played games like stardew valley (well technically my wife played and I watched) or warhammer (specifically the vermintide one) and that was honestly years ago. Maybe I’m wrong but, those I don’t feel like are recent games (came out this year) and when I did watch/play them, they weren’t my cup of tea. I guess I should have been specific (like when I mentioned Destiny, I meant specifically the first one as I played 2 and did not care for it as much).

I’m almost 40 and a pretty avid gamer blessed to be able to play a PLETHORA of games over the last few years through different means (work, personal life, events), with 2 kids and a wife who are all also gamers either various taste whether that be in console (we have most past and present) or game type. I do not live under a rock, maybe a more a pineapple under the sea and my only burden is the business of life but, I’ve still found time to do my gaming and follow my hobbies (for business/pleasure) so I’m not completely out the loop.

I’ve had some great suggestion here to help solidify the push to try certain titles (maybe the art style has been putting me off or mechanics or story didn’t capture me) that I have been putting off or stayed away from. And I appreciate everyone’s suggestions and even opinions but let’s not trip on each other off of video games. The post was meant to just be light hearted and random, not this deep dive into my personal gaming preferences or an attack on others interest lol. 

From one gamer to another, let’s try to foster more positivity and cohesion so we gamers don’t always have to carry the title of toxic and negative and build a more appealing and inviting community.

gaming,"Don't Be Me, Save Your Game (SMTV:Vengeance)","I'm a fool. So I played and beat SMTV when it came out on Switch a while back. I liked it a lot and bought Shin Megami Tensei V:Vengeance on steam while it was on sale this past week. 

I was lulled into a false sense of security because the last two games I played were Metaphor and P3R both which have some level of auto-saving.

I was starting my playthrough of SMTV and going around and eventually get to this one red enemy that they warned me were strong. Well the first red one I fought I defeated easily so I thought it was no big deal. Engage this second one and in it's opening move it hits my whole team with an Almighty attack and wipes me out in one go.

I lost 2 1/2 hours of gameplay lol. First time in a long time I've lost that much gameplay it nearly brought tears to my eyes lol. I had gathered so many demons and leveled them. *sigh*

I know SMTV Vengeance adds some new stuff so I don't know if these red enemies are new or not, it's been so long I forgot most of the original game.

Anyway...make sure to regularly save. What's making me kick myself is I recently had passed a save point and I'm in hindsight mode of WHY DIDNT I SAVE?!

Needless to say I learned my lesson the hard way. At least it was early in the game.
