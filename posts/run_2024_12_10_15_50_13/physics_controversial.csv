Physics,Propagation of untwisting solar jets from the low-beta corona into the super-Alfvénic wind: Testing a solar origin scenario for switchbacks,"Summary of article: 

The phenomenon of ""**Switchbacks**"" (SBs) are localized deflections of the magnetic field in the solar wind, the observations made by the **Parker Solar Probe (PSP)**. The researchers used the Adaptively Refined Magnetohydrodynamics Solver **(ARMS)** method to study. **Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT)** is a numerical technique used in computational simulations, It is designed to handle problems involving fluid or plasma dynamics, where maintaining physical accuracy is essential.

Magnetic Field Strength Falls off as you move farther from the Sun, following a 1/r2 pattern, where r is the distance. Solar wind velocity intensity (Vsw) increases as moving far from the sun. The **Alfvén velocity** is the speed at which Alfvén waves travel through a plasma. It is a concept in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which studies the behavior of ionized gases (plasmas) influenced by magnetic fields. **Alfvén Velocity**  Increases close to the Sun, then decreases because plasma density drops farther away.

Near the Sun, the plasma beta (β) is much less than 1, meaning magnetic pressure is much stronger than gas pressure. Twisting motions occur when magnetic field lines are wound up by the plasma's rotational flow at the photosphere.  **Magnetic Energy** Initially increases as the jet forms due to the build-up of twist in magnetic field lines. Later decreases as this energy is converted into kinetic energy during the jet's launch. 

**Gravitational Energy** Gradually increases as denser plasma lifts away from the Sun.

**Photospheric flow** is related to the rotational motion applied at the Sun’s surface. This motion mimics the natural twisting of magnetic fields caused by plasma flows in the Sun's photosphere. These twisting motions are key to generating solar jets and studying their propagation into the solar wind. Photospheric flow, tangential velocity vb, depends on the **gradient of the radial magnetic field**.",LK_111,1hb2h05,https://reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hb2h05/propagation_of_untwisting_solar_jets_from_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1hb2h05/propagation_of_untwisting_solar_jets_from_the/,2024-12-10 14:04:31,0,0.4,0,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hb2h05
Physics,My finger slipped onto a neighbouring USB port. Is there a risk of electrocution?,"I had a plug adapter that was plugged in and I was trying to remove my USB cable from one of the ports. My finger slipped and fell into a neighbouring port, touching the plastic square inside (possibly even the inside edge too). I’d have thought, it being a plug, I’d have been electrocuted somehow. 

I felt no electrocution/electric shock and there isn’t even a mark on my finger.
