I wasn't really concerned with PC gaming up until I got the Steam Deck and was floored with the how cool and versatile it is. I also have a Steam Deck Dock so I can hook it up to my TV. It does well for what I use it for. But I think I would like to get a gaming PC to play some older games but with much higher resolution and frames.

gaming,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: my thoughts,"Funny no one is talking about it yet. I play on GFN turning everything up to ""supreme"" (I guess ultra is not good enough anymore). It is a very nice looking game. No expense spared (quoting from another Spielberg movie).

Using the opening scene of the first movie as a tutorial is ingenious. Puzzles and actions are good, but I do not think that is what is going to make or break the game. I am hoping for great set pieces and a good story (which is what the reviews said it has).

I have xbox game pass ultimate, so this is already include in the sub but so far (which admittedly I am not that deep into the game yet) I like it.

I think we need more single player, well written narrative based, AAA adventure games. A very much fresh take from the online service games that become more like a job, or the souls like ""can't-beat-without-practice-for-weeks"" beat-them-ups.

gaming,Can someone explain the Indiana Jones hype right now?,"I downloaded it yesterday on my Xbox, and I have to say it’s a pretty mediocre experience for me so far. But the consensus seems to be that it’s going to be GOTY, with people just giving high praise to it.  I feel like I’m missing out on something that’s keeping me from enjoying it. 

My major complaints with this game are that it feels more like an interactive story where I sometimes get to open doors by pressing X and then moving my thumbstick to the left.  When I finally get to see some actual gameplay, it’s mostly stealth. Indiana Jones should be an adventure game, not a stealth game.   Combat when it happens is okay but there’s way better combat in games out there. 

The one thing I do like about combat is there’s lots of options for weapons just lying around that can be easily picked up.  Another thing that’s really the only thing keeping me playing is that the story feels like a real Indiana Jones story, so I keep playing just to find out what happens next. 

Anyway I’m not here to hate on the game, I’m just trying to find out why people love it so much. If I understood that maybe I’d enjoy it more too.  In the meantime I feel like this is a game I’ll play once and never pick up again.

gaming,Silent Hill is Actually More Real Than You Think,"Maybe there isn’t an old abandoned town somewhere full of curses and fog that keeps summoning people to visit and manifest their strongest fears, desires or regrets into physical realities, but for those who does have strong emotions in real life, either self-aware or in their subconsciousness, like something they have experienced in the past that they couldn’t really make peace with deep in, or something that they really fear from happening at the moment, there’s always a Silent Hill in their dream where these subconsciousness would turn into all kinds of mental constructs, not necessarily nightmares but often are, and reminds them of what they have really been trying to escape from in real life, and what they have buried deep down in their mind, often as a self-protection mechanism. 

After playing Silent Hill I have been thinking about many of the dreams that I have from time to time, and many really started to make sense now. It also made me realize that many things that I thought I’ve completely forgotten or let go, actually have much deeper effects on my subconscious then I thought, and realizing it actually helps me to face it better, to actually let go and move on. 

Many horror games are just trying to scare you, but Silent Hill is really trying to teach you how to be brave.
