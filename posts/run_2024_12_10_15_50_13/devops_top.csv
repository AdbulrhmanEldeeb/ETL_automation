devops,Leaving a role within 2 months of starting - moved from Junior to Senior?,"I'm from the UK.  
I worked on support desk for 3 years before landing a Junior DevOps role. I've spent a lot of my time studying, and really making progress in my career. I've reached a point where I feel very confident in my abilities, and have always been very successful in my projects.

I was a Junior DevOps Engineer until 2 months ago - I was Junior for 1 year 4 months - when I got offered and then started a new position as a Senior DevOps Engineer.  
I was thrilled and over the moon. I've worked really hard for this, and it's finally paying off. I've gotten the pay rise from a Junior Role, and I've landed the title of Senior.

However, it's been an absolutely nightmare. I've joined the company and there is my manager and one other engineer. From day one I was being given customer tickets. There is absolutely 0 documentation. Any notes I can find which reference procedures are years out of date.  
I've asked for handover or shadowing sessions so I can get an understanding of things, and my manager says he's busy, but I should learn from doing the JIRA tickets which come in.  
The other engineer is completely non-responsive.

I've been here now 2-months and it's been agonising. The lack of support from my team is one thing, but my manager has now started to turn a tad nasty towards me. He makes constant degrading comments, but plays them off as playful.  
He keeps @ me in group chats to get work done. Even though I'm incredibly overwhelmed.

I'm on the verge of just handing in my notice, but then I feel like it's a disaster for my career.  
I won't be able to include this Senior Role on my CV as I've only been here 2 months - and looks crap to any future employeers.  
It basically puts me in a position where I look like an unemployed Junior Engineer.

Can anyone advise? Part of me says to suck it up for 6 months - that'll give me enough experience to express on my CV and just say it was a poor fit.",ReverendRou,1hafys1,https://reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hafys1/leaving_a_role_within_2_months_of_starting_moved/,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1hafys1/leaving_a_role_within_2_months_of_starting_moved/,2024-12-09 18:03:28,30,0.81,30,0,29,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hafys1

We were able to get TEST up and running but working on PROD has dragged. From production freezes to, TF Debugging , to folks being out. Project has dragged. 

I’m not an expert but I’m trying and trying to avoid reaching out to my leader as he’s kind of just let me do my own thing on this, and hasn’t really checked in either. I know others like our tech lead, who I report to on stand ups provides updates but not sure how often. 

I am a bit frustrated with how some of this is being handled by our partner team. 

Does it make sense to check in and let my leader know where we stand, we don’t necessarily communicate on the day to day but they do oversee my progress and I do check in with them for technical questions or discussions once a month or so.

devops,How to use OpenTelemetry with Prometheus Stack,"Hi,

  
I have setup the prometheus stack with helmfile using the official chart on the ""monitoring"" namespace. And now I have used the same approach and installed the OpenTelemetry collector on ""otel"" namespace.

I have a sample microservice and it's Dockerfile is instrumented with the otel java agent. 

  
And in the otelconfig.yaml, I have the following configurations.



`exporters:`

`debug: {}`

`extensions:`

`health_check:`

`endpoint: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:13133`

`processors:`

`batch: {}`

`k8sattributes:`

`. . .` 

`memory_limiter:`

`check_interval: 5s`

`limit_percentage: 80`

`spike_limit_percentage: 25`

`receivers:`

`filelog:`

`. . .`

`hostmetrics:`

`. . .`

`otlp:`

`protocols:`

`grpc:`

`endpoint: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:4317`

`http:`

`endpoint: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:4318`

`prometheus:`

`config:`

`scrape_configs:`

`- job_name: opentelemetry-collector`

`scrape_interval: 10s`

`static_configs:`

`- targets:`

`- ${env:MY_POD_IP}:8888`

`service:`

`extensions:`

`- health_check`

`pipelines:`

`logs:`

`exporters:`

`- debug`

`processors:`

`- k8sattributes`

`- memory_limiter`

`- batch`

`receivers:`

`- otlp`

`- filelog`

`metrics:`

`exporters:`

`- debug`

`processors:`

`- k8sattributes`

`- memory_limiter`

`- batch`

`receivers:`

`- otlp`

`- prometheus`

`- hostmetrics`

`traces:`

`exporters:`

`- debug`

`processors:`

`- k8sattributes`

`- memory_limiter`

`- batch`

`receivers:`

`- otlp`

`telemetry:`

`metrics:`

`address: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:8888`

  
What I want now is:

  
1. How to tell the OTEL agent running in my sample microservice to send the metrics data to this OTEL collector.  
  
2. And how to then send this data to Prometheus? - how to add this to otel config and which endpoint should I use? What else should I configure etc.



I am always confused with this approach of OTEL (as it has multiple receivers and exporters where one can use prometheus in both receivers and exporters). 



I appreciate your guidance or any documentation (not the official documentation as it is a bit confusing) where I can learn this?

2. ELK - kibana/grafana for logs
3. OTEl and Dynatrace/prometheus- grafna?

devops,"'Leveling Up' a developer, how to shift mindset to security? Just keep trying?","There's dev from an acquisition years ago who wears the title 'DevOps Engineer'.  So our director wanted me to move some of my workload to him.

Baby steps, I let him handle migrating their teams to GitHub.  When he moved their package repository they had some difficulty setting it up, developers couldn't access it.

He jumped to a conclusion (that it was permissions issue) and asked me.... wait for it.... you'll never guess...  ""could you create a PAT with repo admin rights that we can share with the devs so they can access the packages"".

I explained why it wasn't going to happen and asked him to walk the other devs through the step by step instructions I provided and tested with the help of 2 other devs with normal access.  He assured me that it's not working and they setup exactly like I said..  I'm sure you've heard this story before.
