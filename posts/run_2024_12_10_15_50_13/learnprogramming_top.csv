learnprogramming,Programming Class in School,"Hopefully this is the best place to ask this question.

I am a high school math teacher, with a coding background.  If I'm being honest, I haven't coded in almost 20 years, and my main coding language was C++ and Visual Basic, so my background doesn't really mean a lot at this point.

Our school is looking to implement a coding class into the curriculum, in the upcoming semester.  I'm looking at about 5 weeks to prepare a 18 week course, and I'm hoping you can help.  I have talked to my brother, who is a programmer, and he suggests emphasizing in either Python, C# or Java.  So looks like I'll be learning with them for at least the first year.

Anyway, for those who are a little more advanced at programming, do you have any other suggestions?  (I am aware of the CS50 that Harvard offers, I might use that for the class as well)

Thanks!

learnprogramming,Merging two Arrays together in C. Why does this work?,"Hi, for learning i tried to program c code, that merges two monotonically increasing arrays into a new one inside of a function. I tried for hours, did one approach with pointers (didn't went that good) and this one. It works, but i can't wrap my head around why. Here is the code of the function (look for the comments): 

    unsigned merge(int array_1[], int array_2[], int length_1, int length_2) {
    
      int array_3[length_1 + length_2];
      int *ptr_1 = array_1;
      int *ptr_2 = array_2;
    
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; length_1 + length_2; i++) {
    
        if ( i &gt; length_1 + 3) { //Why does this work?
          array_3[i] = *ptr_2++;
        } else if ( i &gt; length_2 + 3) { //Why does this work?
          array_3[i] = *ptr_1++;
        } else {
          array_3[i] = *ptr_1 &lt;= *ptr_2 ? *ptr_1++ : *ptr_2++;
        }
      }
    
      int length_3 = sizeof(array_3) / sizeof(*array_3);
    
      for (int j = 0; j &lt; length_3; j++) {
    
        printf(""[%d]: %d\n"", j, array_3[j]);
      }
    
      return length_3;
    }

I know now how to program it more readable but why does this if-condition i &gt; length + 3 work? Initially the idea behind those conditions was to stop getting values from the shorter array, when the pointer is at the end of the array. I tried several things but this + 3 made it work, but that doesn't seem to make any sense. Maybe someone can explain this to me.

learnprogramming,Best approach to store data values in the database from an OCR scan for a rule-based system?,"I'm using OCR to scan a document and compile all findings in a single field in a JSON-like structure (e.g. ""gender: male, age: 2, country: Yemen""). It should be noted that it is necessary to use the OCR to scan the findings, so it is expected that the scanned results will always be different/inaccurate.

The reason for compiling all in a single field is because the findings from the OCR are inconsistent or unstructured, like different amount of info/fields in every document, or different kinds of info/fields in every document. And most importantly, I'm using a rule-based system to filter records based on the findings (e.g. input:""get me all males aged 20-40 that live in Yemen""). 

Is storing all findings in a single field a good approach for a rule-based system? BTW i'm using a non-relational database (MongoDB).

learnprogramming,Is there any workaround for using PyCharm CE on a remote machine (ssh)? Or do I need to switch to VSCode?,"I've been using PyCharm for many many years and I absolutely love it. I mainly code (99%) in Python, so PyCharm has always been the easy choice. I recently started doing some work where I have to ssh into a machine to run my scripts and while I can write the code locally, there's no way in PycharmCE to run a debugger onto a remote machine and see all the steps locally. I'm aware of the [remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-development-starting-page.html) from the professional edition of Pycharm, but my work does not allow for it, I can only use the community edition.

I know that VSCode has a similar option to work on a remote machine and it's free, so I could switch to that, but my muscle memory is so tied to the Pycharm workflow that switching to VSCode is going to affect my productivity for at least a few months, until I learn it all from scratch.

So, before I switch to VSCode for good, is there any workaround for using PyCharm remotely using the community edition? Oh, I can't simply install PyCharm on the remote machine because it doesn't have a graphic server (it's container stuff), so I can only use ssh.
