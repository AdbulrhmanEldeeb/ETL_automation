learnprogramming,Should I learn C++?,"Hey I'm a first year undergraduate doing a Bachelors in Computer Science. I've been programming for quite a while now and I really love it... or so I thought. I realise now that I'm not very interested in most of the hot areas like machine learning, web/app development or game development in Unity, etc. What I'm actually interested in is stuff that makes me really think like programming puzzles, or maybe making a physics engine, making an algorithm visualiser, making a compiler, etc.

And I realised that maybe C++ is a good language because it seems like most of the things I'm interested in (compilers, graphics programming, OS) are done using it. But I've also heard that it's a very complicated language and takes a long time to learn well enough to land a good job in it. But I want to be able to get a decent internship and job by the end of my degree.

So what would be the best thing for me to do?

learnprogramming,Why is stepping through in Release so fickle?,"I'm working on a project where atm it doesn't work properly in debug (not ideal, but not really within the scope of my task to resolve it). Since I can set breakpoints in Release, I just do that. But it behaves so weirdly. Like it will visually skip over code that actually *is* executing; or I can hover and see the contents of a variable that's passed to the function as an argument but I can't see the contents of a variable that was given a value within the function (and adding the variable to the watched variables also doesn't work--says ""variable is undefined"")

I don't understand why stepping through in Release behaves so inexplicably. If the answer is ""you should use Debug to step through code"", then why does everything else about VS indicate that you can use Release to do it?

    import js from '@eslint/js'
    import globals from 'globals'
    import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks'
    import reactRefresh from 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh'
    import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint'
    
    export default tseslint.config(
      { ignores: ['dist'] },
      {
        extends: [js.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended],
        files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
        languageOptions: {
          ecmaVersion: 2020,
          globals: globals.browser,
        },
        plugins: {
          'react-hooks': reactHooks,
          'react-refresh': reactRefresh,
        },
        rules: {
          ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
          'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
            'warn',
            { allowConstantExport: true },
          ],
        },
      },
    )

I tried to pass the rules, but VSCode either completely ignores the rules and doesnt format the code or just throws an error in the ouput terminal for Eslint.

  
Anybody knows how to reconfigure it ?",BluesyPompanno,1hayelh,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hayelh/eslint_prettier_and_vscode_config/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1hayelh/eslint_prettier_and_vscode_config/,2024-12-10 09:56:53,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,t3_1hayelh
