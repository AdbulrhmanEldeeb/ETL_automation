books,Do you fall into a reading slump at certain times of the year? ,"
I always seem to fall into a reading slump this time of year. Some years, I manage to read a few books before I just can’t stand reading anymore. Other years, I did not read a single book in the month of December. 

My guess is that it’s the end of the year and I’m burnt out from all the reading I’ve done. I also tend to fall into a big reading slump in either June or July, the halfway point of the year where I’m overwhelmed with all the books I still “need” to read. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you fall into slumps randomly or do they happen at specific points in the year?

books,Reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac made very nostalgic for a time I never lived in ,"Disclaimer: I know, like most books in its vein, On the Road was sensationalized to a degree. I also understand that the Beat Generation was countercultural and Kerouac’s writings do not represent the general views of people of the 1950s. 

That being said, as a Gen-Z guy who recently finished this book, I was really struck by how unusual so many of the formative, chaotic experiences portrayed in this story would be in the America of today. On an obvious level, hitchhiking and carpooling with random people cross country are largely a thing of the past. I also found the characters rolling into random towns and instantly getting informal work as unrealistic. I mean, these days you have to submit an online resume for Walmart, and they’re also gonna run a background check, which would have severely hampered Dean’s employment opportunities. People also just take fewer chances now. Statistically, our generation uses way less drugs, has way less sex, and is a lot more cynical than the On the Road crew. 

But also on a deeper level, it feels like there’s a huge difference between what “finding yourself” involves now and what it involved then. Maybe more than in the late 40s and early 50s, people are expected to take their 20s to find themselves today. But you don’t really get lost anymore. People usually study abroad or see Europe through a tour company. If they go to Africa, it’s through a safari; Mexico is through a resort package. Even Mount Everest has somehow been commodified. And of course, for all of those trips you’ll be in constant contact with the outside world, have directions to everything on your smartphone, and be cataloguing the whole thing on social media. How many people are camping in the middle of the Mexican jungle on the roof of their car, as Dean and Sal did? Moreover, in contrast to the live  jazz clubs where Dean acted like an absolute madman, you’ll be paying $20+ covers to get in today’s clubs for the opportunity to stand around and take pictures of the light show while listening to remixes of 20 year old music. It’s like when the majority of people start to see young adulthood as a time of impulsive hedonism and self discovery, a framework for how that hedonism and self discovery is supposed to be done starts to emerge, and the whole thing feels a lot less adventurous. It becomes scheduled, ordered, and expensive—sometimes done more for others than yourself. Maybe adventure is still there, but it’s certainly way less messy. 

And I guess in more concrete terms, that’s what On the Road makes me nostalgic for: a time before we’d set out to remove all the messiness from life. In Kerouac’s day you could bounce around the West for a few years without having to worry so much about how the gap on your resume would look to employers. You could earn fine money living in the Dakotas and hitching rides to work on the harvests. People weren’t always connected; they couldn’t just Google how places looked, and when they went out on an adventure, it felt like they were really going into the unknown. Paradoxically, it feels like in a time that is seen as much more socially restrained, life could be much freer. 

The message I took out of On the Road was that, ultimately, the chaos of youth gives way to adult responsibilities. But, that doesn’t make the chaos pointless, unfulfilling, or wrong. It’s really a necessary step in development that challenges your preconceptions, puts your life in perspective, and gives you a concept of something beyond yourself before you do surrender to responsibility. I see the diminishment of this developmental phase and the commodification of chaos and adventure today as being a very unfortunate thing. Of course, Dean’s philosophy had major drawbacks (his general sexism and willingness to abandon women read pretty badly today), but I think the general point stands: adventure isn’t the same now as it was then. 

I would be interested in how others read the “beat” writers today, or, if any of you are of that generation, if you see this analysis as true. I think overall, while this book was definitely a product of its time, I found it to be very thought provoking and enjoyable, largely because of how well it captured spontaneous youthful exuberance and the atmosphere of the era.

For me, it's *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin. The title of the book is what pulled me in. It's directly quoted in the book as ""Light is the left hand of darkness, and darkness the right hand of light"". Its referring to the age old thought that light and dark need to exist together and you can't have one without the other.

books,1Q84-Haruki Murakami,"Just finished the novel yesterday. First of all, even though I say that every single I finish a long novel by Murakami, no matter how much doubt or hate he may be receiving as of late, it's an objectively challenging task to write a novel 1318 pages long and have the reader's boredom or weariness be minimal (or to be honest close to nonexistent) and he absolutely achieved that, so I take my hat off to him. Having said that, I found 1Q84 to be a particularly enjoyable and gripping page turner. This is not always necessary to make for an amazing read, and every novel that is enjoyable to read is not necessarily amazing, but if I'm being honest, the best reads are those in which those two qualities come together. That in my humble opinion of course. And 1Q84 certainly was one of those for me. As a reader I generally tend to believe that the journey is more importnant than the destination, but it would be a blatant lie to not admit that 1Q84 had one of the most satisfactory endings of any piece of fiction I've read in recent momory both from a somewhat objective literal standpoint and my personal view/interpretation/liking/preference of its characters and story&gt;! (with the exception of Ushikawa's death which I found totally unfair and frustrating but I guess that wonderful scene featuring the creation of an Air Chrysalis out of his dead body by the little people makes up for it).!&lt; All in all, despite the novel's main thesis being relatively simple and old as time (basically a slightly more sophisticated take on the whole concept of soulmates and the inescapability of fate), Murakami always has his special ways to make everything so magical, so vivid, multi layered and lively that even though it's not always entirely necessary, it's always what I want going into a novel of his. And it was welcome especially in this kind of novel which in my eyes is far less cold and distanced compared to other novels by Murakami and which demands its reader to surrender his own life a bit for the ones of it characters, for quite some time due to its length.  I guess that's all I wanted to say for now, but I would love what other people who have read it feel about it. Specifically I would also like to hear the other readers' opinions and thoughts on Fuka-Eri as a charcter and her significance to the story. To me, she really was the border that ended up bringing Tengo and Aomame together, but what I'm not sure about is whether this was her real mission from the very start.&gt;! Did the guys from Sakige, knowing that Leader would sooner or later die costing them the hearing of the voice, send Fuka-Eri just to bring these two together so that Aomame would produce in heir/a dohta to whom the ability would be passed (but why would that have to be Tengo's and Aomame's baby?) or was it just a coincidence, planned not by some human factor but simply the universe itself (if there is such a thing)?!&lt; Intrigued to hear your thoughts.",I-Like-What-I-Like24,1haf463,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1haf463/1q84haruki_murakami/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1haf463/1q84haruki_murakami/,2024-12-09 17:29:35,35,0.75,35,0,41,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haf463

books,Yet another post on Ulysses.,"As the title suggests, I am currently reading Ulysses by James Joyce. As of now, I’ve finished part 1. And what the hell am I reading?

It’s awful. Both in the technical and literary sense. From
What I’ve read so far, it follows a day in the life of a guy named Stephen Deadalus. An Irish Catholic who is sad because he is Irish and Catholic. As for the technical writing, I was able to follow it at first. The guy talks with his room-mates, and then goes to work as a teacher. After that, it’s like Joyce took acid, threw a bunch of non sequitar sentences at the page, and called it a day.

For example; 
“His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: Mouth to her womb. Oomb, all wombing tomb. His mouth mounded issuing-breath, unspeeched ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globes, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, Blast them. Old Deasy’s letter. Here. Thanking you for hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table rock and scribbled words. Thats twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter. 

That’s one paragraph. Using the same formatting as the book. As far as I can tell he might be looking at a woman? Maybe a prostitute? I can’t tell. 

Joyce chose to write at least ten pages like this. It’s a strange flow of consciousness that goes nowhere. Masters of an art can choose to break the rules. But is that really what happened here?

As for the plot, it’s not great. A little research before hand told me to look out for parallels with the odyssey. This is the closest I’ve been able to get. One of Deadalus’s housemates is an Englishman. It’s kind of like the suitors partying it up while Odysseus is away. 

What I have seen a lot more of is wasted potential. Now, I’m not going to explain the entirety of irelands subjugation. I’d need a history degree k don’t possess to do it justice. There’s a LOT there. But suffice to say that historically, England treated the Irish like second class citizens, going so far as to suppress their language and culture. 

Deadalus is angry about that. However, he is bunking up with possibly the only Englishman who gives a damn. The guy only views it as a trifle, but he wants to know about Gaelic language and culture! Instead of taking the opportunity to educate the man, potentially create a linguistic record, and influence his views, Deadalus considers him to be a nuisance. As if he is somehow trying to usurp the culture. 

This is exemplified during a scene with a milk maid. The Englishman asks if she knows any Gaelic phrases. She asks if he means Irish, and then says no. Deadalus spends the next paragraph thinking about how awful the woman is, because (paraphrasing) her genitals are not like gods genitals and are like the genitals of eve which were tempted and are sinful. (Please note Deadalus is supposed to be a reflection of Joyce) 

(As a small aside, this would be a good place to note that Deadalus has no actual faith. He follows cultural norms, and Thats about it. Except when he can demean women. That seems to be an exception)

Continuing on the theme of wasted opportunity, he goes on to his job as a teacher. There, he sees a student he thinks is similar to himself. As previously stated, he is upset about the loss of Irish culture. As a teacher, he has an opportunity to guide the next generation. Maybe Instill them with some of that language and culture. But he doesn’t. He just teaches them the bare curriculum and sends them in their way. 

It shouldn’t be his job to solve the cultural suppression. Realistically, there isn’t much he can do. But he doesn’t even really seem to make much of an effort. It’s like he’s angry that it’s raining, but doesn’t even bother seeking cover. 

All of this tells a story about a mopey man who has no hope. Not every protagonist should be sympathetic. But so far it’s like reading about paint drying. Instead of a character whose goals I can support, I’m reading about a husk with little to no direction or drive. It’s neither entertaining, nor does it seem to convey any particular message. 

So that leaves me with the question, what is all the hype about? Does it suddenly get better in part 2? I read reviews calling it one of the greatest novels of all time. But about two thirds of what I read so far is barely coherent, let alone “great”

So what am I missing? Am I just not smart enough to see genius buried under the gibberish? I’m willing to believe that. But if Joyce purposefully hid the art and quality, he did a good job of it with words like “contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality”.",cain11112,1hatf4o,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hatf4o/yet_another_post_on_ulysses/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hatf4o/yet_another_post_on_ulysses/,2024-12-10 04:17:05,0,0.3,0,0,21,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,,spoiler,t3_1hatf4o
