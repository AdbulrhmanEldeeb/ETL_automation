Hey there,

For the past few months, I‚Äôve been working on an open-source library for creating faceless videos.

I‚Äôm considering turning it into an API so developers can easily integrate it by simply providing the script in scenes.

The API would generate:
	‚Ä¢	Voice
	‚Ä¢	Images
	‚Ä¢	Transitions
	‚Ä¢	Captions

I‚Äôm thinking of pricing it at around $0.10 per minute rendered to cover AI generation costs.

Is this something you‚Äôd be willing to pay for?

programming,My snake game got to 57 bytes by just messing around and basically refactoring most of the code,"This byte reduction was different than the others.

Usually, I have an idea in mind of how to reduce a byte and I try to manipulate the code to make it work.


This time I was bored so I looked at the code again just because I wanted to remove the usage of the BP register because I thought ""it had potential"", you can see the PR where I managed to do so without increasing the byte count [here](https://github.com/donno2048/snake/pull/68), then after quite some time I realized a way to abuse this in such a way that would use another register (DX) to store some values without adding any bytes and thought it has some potential too because the DX initialization takes 3 bytes and could maybe be reduced somehow...

I merged the PR as it made the game a little slower even though it didn't save any bytes because I couldn't think of a way to optimize the initialization of DX, but then I realized that the initialization of DX isn't the problem, it's the solution to another problem.

The way I initialized AX up until now was with a `MOV` which is quite a waste to just set AX to 0, but I had to use a `MOV` for the `LDS` initialization, because the first byte of the `MOV` was 0xB8, but if I initialized DX there I would solve the problem and I would be able to set AX in less than 3 bytes.


The problem is that `MOV DX,` won't have 0xB8 at the beginning so I have to use `MOV AX,`, but no problem, I can initialize AX to the value I want in DX and do a `XCHG`, but then I'm left with just one byte to set AX to 0 which is impossible (and that was the reason I didn't commit that into the original PR). 

But, then I realized, we can set `DX` to 0 with just 1 byte so that after the `XCHG` AX will already contain 0.

I planted a `CWD` right between the `MOV` and the `XCHG` so that DX will be set to the MSB of the wanted value in DX which is positive so the MSB is 0.

I reverted the changes made from the first PR and merged the [new one](https://github.com/donno2048/snake/pull/69).

BTW, this time I couldn't just use the 0x0 dummy byte as that would set DX wrongly, so I had to use `LDS DI, [BX+SI+0x0]` which apparently can't be parsed correctly by nasm even with `-O0` because it always drops the 0x0, so I had to hardcode it.",Perfect-Highlight964,1h89eyl,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h89eyl/my_snake_game_got_to_57_bytes_by_just_messing/,https://github.com/donno2048/snake,2024-12-06 19:23:50,750,0.94,750,0,79,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h89eyl

programming,This PR replaces is-number package with a one-liner with identical code. Author argues this tiny change saves 440GB weekly traffic. JavaScript micro-package debate ,"A debate occurred between the author of the is-number package (and is-odd, is-even, and 1500more) and a PR author over micro-libraries. https://github.com/micromatch/to-regex-range/pull/17


The PR proposed replacing the 'is-number' package with its inline code. While the code is &lt;1KB, the full package with README/license is ~10KB. With 70M weekly downloads, this simple change saves 440GB of npm bandwidth weekly.

The author of 'is-number' called the PR ""useless"" - despite it being his own code just moved inline. Some of his other packages include 'is-odd' which depends on 'is-even' which depends on... you guessed it, 'is-number'.

The debate:
Pro micro-packages: Well-tested, auto-updates, saves dev time
Against: Security risks, fragile dependencies (remember left-pad?), unnecessary bloat

TL;DR: JavaScript's micro-package ecosystem might be getting out of hand. Sometimes the simplest solution is just writing the code yourself. Or standards library when?

The library features explicit table aliasing, null safety through Rust's Option type, intuitive aggregates that guarantee single results per joined row, type-safe foreign key navigation and unique lookups, multi-versioned schema support with type-safe migrations, and encapsulated row IDs tied to transaction lifetimes, all while using SQLite as its backend database engine. It allows developers to write database queries that feel native to Rust, with the schema defined using enum syntax that generates the necessary database API code, enabling safe and intuitive database interactions with strong compile-time checks.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",Balance-,1h4dovu,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1h4dovu/announcing_rustquery_safe_relational_database/,https://blog.lucasholten.com,2024-12-01 21:12:34,15,0.69,15,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1h4dovu

programming,New language: Universal Scripting Language (.usl) ," 

Hi there,

I‚Äôm custom rom-developing my watch. I‚Äôm at the point where the scripts are written and I‚Äôm learning vscode to implement the build. 

I‚Äôm a leading global researcher for multiple domains such as AI, science, biomedical development, blah de fucking blah. No one cares. 

I‚Äôve invented a new coding language called Universal Scripting Language. (.usl), that can utilize 400+ coding languages in one setup. It got its MIT license, so I don‚Äôt know if I need the Apache 2.0 as well but, whatever happy to have both if needed. I‚Äôm building the IDE currently with scheduling and automation built in. The first test was to see if it could run itself which it did. Very cool to see. I think I recorded that part. It‚Äôll be used within my watch build in some really cool ways. I hope you‚Äôll find it interesting. I‚Äôm including the interpreter and translation software into the watch so you can mod to your hearts content and help develop cool shit. 
I‚Äôve got the syntax ready and the beginnings of an O-Reilly-inspired book for it in the works. 

Anyway. Would anyone be interested in the progress of this? I‚Äôm a literal shutin who‚Äôs bedridden often with muscular dystrophy and schizoaffective disorder but I‚Äôm also happy to show how it‚Äôs coming along. It‚Äôs designed to help you live as long as possible. I have trouble with hallucinations and being unable to sleep (no rem anymore) and working is all I know how to do. I can‚Äôt seem to work normally anymore. 

If I could figure out a way to make a living creating cool shit I think I have the production gear to do a legit series on it, if you would like a video or podcast I‚Äôve done both. Streaming is doable but I can‚Äôt talk while working. It lets you listen to music or online stuff. I would just need to ask for some guidance on what you would like to see, what to look out for‚Äîcommunity stuff. 

After the watch is released, artificial kidneys are ready as are universal donor blood types from any stem cell. I‚Äôm just a bit stuck in my house at the moment. (Sorry if this is meandering‚Äîmental illness is hard to explain through.)

Thanks.

Hi everyone!üëã

I‚Äôm exiting to charge a project I‚Äôve been working on - TGV (French express trains), a lightweight C# library designed to simplify the process of building HTTP servers. Inspired by simplicity and flexibility of ExpressJS, I created this to be a cross-platform easy-to-use framework for building apps. 

üéØFeatures:

üåêHTTP(S) request handling with routings 

üîìMiddleware support

üñ•Ô∏èCross-platform (at least Linux and Windows)

üì¶Minimal dependencies and no boilerplates


üöÄGetting started

You can check out and try library on GitHub and NuGet today! The library is still in development stage so any feedback, suggestions or contributions are very welcome!

Feel free to ask any question, I‚Äôll be happy to answer them!

programming,Real-Time Video Processing - iPhone Continuity Camera - Active Graph Networks,"Hey r/Programming,

I‚Äôve been working on a project that processes raw iPhone camera data in real time, applying dynamic enhancements like stabilization, UV filtering, and even simulated AC130-style thermal effects. This all runs through a compact, custom-built pipeline using a relational neural network and a 4D programming framework I‚Äôve been experimenting with.

The framework models state changes in video data over time, mapping it into a ‚Äú4D‚Äù structure that includes spatial, temporal, and attribute dimensions. This allows for real-time effects that adapt dynamically as the camera moves or conditions change.

The cool part? It‚Äôs running off consumer-grade hardware‚Äîa MacBook paired with an iPhone using Continuity Camera as the feed. The framework‚Äôs focus is on lightweight, efficient processing that could be adapted for mobile devices or edge computing.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure how this compares to how cameras or computers traditionally work, but I think there‚Äôs something novel here.

Happy to be told I‚Äôm wrong‚Äîor that this is just reinventing something better done elsewhere! Either way, I‚Äôd love feedback or to hear if this sparks ideas for applications I might not have considered.",Internal_Vibe,1guohc7,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1guohc7/realtime_video_processing_iphone_continuity/,https://youtu.be/mdILzkYX4bU?si=RA_DH6c07gEWsSYS,2024-11-19 04:02:21,0,0.42,0,0,2,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1guohc7

programming,C web framework with ‚Äúkernel like‚Äù modules. ,"

I‚Äôve been working on my hobby project inspired by kernel modules. The idea is: write some raw C code, upload it to a server, and it compiles and runs it at runtime. No precompilation, no restarts. :D

C isn‚Äôt usually the go-to for web dev (for good reasons), but here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve tried to make it less painful:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Slow Build Cycles: Upload code, and the server handles the rest‚Äîlike ""hot reloading,"" but in C.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Speed vs. Practicality: Great for scenarios where performance actually matters, like data-heavy or real-time stuff.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Memory Management: Modules are isolated, so crashes don‚Äôt take everything down.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Built-In Libraries: Comes with SQLite3, OpenSSL, and Jansson support to save you from reinventing the wheel.

It‚Äôs just a proof of concept, not production-ready (please don‚Äôt deploy it), but it‚Äôs fun to work on! Would love any feedback on it. It allows for some interesting possibilities, like being able to update WebSocket handlers at runtime without even closing the WebSocket connection.",warothia,1gtieba,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1gtieba/c_web_framework_with_kernel_like_modules/,https://github.com/joexbayer/c-web-modules,2024-11-17 17:15:15,85,0.81,85,0,28,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,,t3_1gtieba

programming,Miss Notion AI in Obsidian? Here‚Äôs My Plan to Bring It Back with a Plugin! üöÄ,"

As a university student who recently transitioned from Notion to Obsidian, one feature I sorely miss is the floating Notion AI chatbot that was always available for quick assistance. Inspired by that, I‚Äôve started developing a plugin for Obsidian that brings a similar experience, using the Gemini API for note summarization, content generation, and more‚Äîall directly within the Obsidian workspace!

The plugin, Obsi AI, is designed to seamlessly integrate into Obsidian‚Äôs powerful markdown environment, providing AI-powered help whenever you need it. Whether you're looking for quick note summaries, brainstorming ideas, or generating content, Obsi AI aims to streamline your workflow without leaving your notes.

üîπ Key Features:

- Instant content generation and note summarization
- Context-aware responses based on your notes
- Interactive assistant available within the Obsidian workspace

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE : I‚Äôm developing this plugin as a hobby, and while I‚Äôm a cybersec undergraduate rather than a pro developer, so code may be I‚Äôm passionate about making this tool useful for fellow Obsidian users. If you're interested in collaborating or have feature suggestions, I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

Feel free to check out the GitHub repository, and if you like what you see, please give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è to show your support!
