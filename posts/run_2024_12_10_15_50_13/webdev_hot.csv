webdev,"Warning, Smartrmail app contains 'bad' automatic permissions in the terms &amp; conditions, and will plant your business's email in everyones' spam.","I recently made a giant mistake by downloading this one Shopify add-on app... right from that wholesome official Shopify app store.

I recently decided to try out this marketing app, Smartrmail (bad idea). I have to say... the experience was so negative, that I felt the need to protect fellow store owners.

Once you download the app, you'll notice the option to create a password for your account (recommended by the app for ""security purposes"" lol). Once you create a password, you'll never be able to delete your account or change the email attached. Not kidding.

The option to delete your account isn't available. You cannot remove your important business-email from this account profile. The option isn't available. You will be stuck.

Next, they'll start sending shitty emails from a shitty template from your email address, because you agreed to 'let' them by checking the box that says ""I agree to these terms and conditions."" They will send emails to every single one of your customers, and the emails look TERRIBLE.

This is so heinous, I had to dig deeper. The company was active about three years ago in late 2020, and then closed it's doors. The application business, Smartrmail, was acquired in 2023 by new owners. At the bottom of the page, the app claims to be owned by Intercom (Google showed it as an AI chat bot business for retail), however, there isn't any proof anywhere else on the web that shady ass Smartrmail is ACTUALLY owned by Intercom. The Shopify app store says it's owned by a company called Relay. So, who is who? We just don't know yet.

Worse, this app has received 500+ 5 star reviews... yet their official youtube channel has less than 100 views total for the three half-ass AI videos they have up. All of them use AI voices. Why on earth wouldn't anybody want their actual name/face or voice affiliated with Smartrmail. Is there something wrong with it? I'm still seriously considering calling the US &amp; Australian FBI, this app is sooooo effing shady. It blows my mind the Shopify app store approved it... yikes

I care about this community, so that's why I'm recommending you stay away from this super-scam Smartrmail app on Shopify. You deserve better. We all do. I love Shopify as much as the rest of us. I can't believe Shopify is letting this app continue... so embarrassing for them.

Don't believe me? Log-out, and open a separate, free 30-day Shopify trial using a dummy email address, and see for yourself. You'll see what I'm talking about. This app is designed to hurt sellers. I'm honestly not sure what can be done about this.",AutumnLeaves420,1hau8mv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hau8mv/warning_smartrmail_app_contains_bad_automatic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hau8mv/warning_smartrmail_app_contains_bad_automatic/,2024-12-10 05:02:56,21,0.82,21,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1hau8mv
webdev,I made a new programming language to simplify web development - would love your feedback!,"Hey everyone! üëã

I wanted to share a project I'm really excited about - a new programming language called BuckshotPlusPlus that aims to make web development more intuitive.  
Here's how a simple component looks:

    view button {
        type = ""button""
        content = ""Click me!""
        background-color = ""#007bff""
        color = ""white""
        padding = ""10px 20px""
    }

  
The language includes built-in session handling, data caching, and component management. I'm working on video tutorials on [youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0k22uoR9Bc&amp;list=PLttkrjVo_pZoPMCZgw_ByK6Y9Yb_r--oA&amp;index=3)to help people get started , and I'd love your input on what topics to cover!  
The project is open source: [https://github.com/BuckshotPlusPlus/BuckshotPlusPlus](https://github.com/BuckshotPlusPlus/BuckshotPlusPlus)

webdev,update on my open-source social media scheduler,"Hi everyone, I built a little bit more into my open-source free scheduler :)

Postiz is an open-source social media scheduling tool that offers scheduling on the following:

Instagram, YouTube, Dribbble, LinkedIn, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, Threads, X, Slack, Discord, Mastodon and BlueSky.

[https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)

There are some cool new features:

* Option to add stories to Instagram and tag people for collaboration.
* Customer separation - you can group accounts per customer, and when you schedule, you can filter by customer.
* Option to tag companies on LinkedIn (I wanted to tag people also, but it was not possible)
* Fixes for different social media posts failing.
* **Introducing Plugs!** This is a concept you can find in other tools that can boost your engagement for your current posts. Here are some examples:
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, repost it (to regain visibility to it)
   * Once your post reaches X amount of likes, add another message to it (all your existing commenters will get a notification)

**What's next:**

* Public API - I have been too lazy to make it, I have to push more :)
* One Inbox - so you can reply to all your messages from one place.
* Google My Business provider
* AI Agents - I am still trying to figure out what to do with it, but it looks interesting.

webdev,Launched an Open Source Tool on Product Hunt. Want to share why I built it.,"Over the past year of building AI-enabled SaaS applications, I kept hitting the same wall. Going from a Jupyter notebook full of AI RAG techniques to something usable in my app was a nightmare. I'm sure if anyone here has taking a look at llama-index or langchain cookbook sections you might understand what I'm talking about.  
  
I came to the conclusion that this is the problem:  
\- Notebooks are great for testing ideas, but they‚Äôre not meant for building applications around them.  
\- I had to manually dissect notebooks, build a proof-of-concept API server, integrate it into my app, and pray it worked.  
\- The feedback loop was \*painfully\* long‚Äîand most of the time, I canned the project because it didn‚Äôt quite fit.  
  
This frustration comes from a gap in roles:  
1. Data Scientists/AI Devs want notebooks to experiment with methods and techniques‚Äîbut it's not their main focus to also create an API for other applications to use.  
2. App Developers just want simple APIs to test and integrate quickly to see if it actually enhances their app.

This is where KitchenAI comes in. A tool that bridges this gap by transforming your AI Jupyter notebooks into production-ready API server in minutes.  
  
But why??  
\- Shorter Development Cycles  
Test, iterate, and deploy AI techniques faster and cut the feedback loop in half.  
\- Vendor and Framework Agnostic  
Use the libraries you‚Äôre comfortable with, no lock-ins.  
\- Plugin Architecture  
Extend functionality with plugins for evaluation frameworks, observability, prompt management, and more.  
\- Open Source and Local-First  
Built on trusted technologies like Django, so you stay in control‚Äîno 3rd-party dependencies required.  
\- Docker-Ready  
Share your API server as a lightweight container for easy collaboration.  
  
We‚Äôve released KitchenAI as an Apache-licensed open-source tool, so anyone can use it. Up next is a managed cloud version with deeper integrations, metrics, analytics, and workflows for teams with more complex needs. One short term goal is to go straight from colab to a KitchenAI cloud hosted API so development can be absolutely seamless.

webdev,I created this all-in-one JSON Toolkit,"This post might come across as a bit self-promotional, but I created this tool for personal use, and some of my colleagues have found it helpful. It's mainly for developers and testers, so I think r/webdev is a good place to share it, and I hope it will be useful to others too.

This tool addresses some pain points I face when developing, debugging, or testing features that involve JSON data.

* I often need to search for each key whenever I get the data, so I built a way to query multiple keys at once.
* It's difficult to remember deep paths to locate my data, so I built a JSON viewer that lets me extract any path by simply clicking on the key.

Some might argue that I should use Postman test scripts or Postgres' `json_extract_path`. But I find these solutions better suited for stable APIs or data. When I‚Äôm developing a new feature or debugging an issue, the target field can pop into my mind at any moment. So I prefer to quickly access the field and the data directly, rather than having to write a Postman script or SQL query.

webdev,I Built a WordPress Plugin to Solve My Own Problem‚ÄîLooking for Feedback on How to Share It ,"Hey Reddit!

I‚Äôve recently built a WordPress plugin, and I‚Äôm at the stage where I could really use your advice on how to productize and share it with others.

Here‚Äôs the backstory: I was developing a WordPress plugin, and every time I made a small change, I had to:  
1Ô∏è Zip the folder  
2Ô∏è Upload it to WordPress  
3Ô∏è Install it  
4Ô∏è Activate it  
5Ô∏è Test

And I was doing this *every 2-3 minutes.*

Coming from modern frameworks like Vue, where **hot reloads** are standard, this felt painfully outdated. So, I decided to create something that would let me just push my changes to GitHub and have it automatically sync and deploy.

That‚Äôs how **RepoSync** was born‚Äîa plugin that simplifies WordPress development workflows. It‚Äôs functional and ready to go! Here‚Äôs what it does:

* **Auto-syncs with GitHub** so you can skip the zip-upload madness. Just push ti Github and your plugin will be updated automatically
* Supports **private repos**, even on the free tier
* Lets you connect to **specific branches**
* Keeps the setup super simple so anyone can use it (no setting up web hooks, just a simple oauth approval with read permissions)

There are other tools on the market, but I found them either missing key features (like auto-sync or private repo support), were too tedious to set up, or too expensive for what they offer.

**Here‚Äôs where I need your help:**

* **How should I productize it?** I‚Äôm considering a **generous free tier** (maybe limiting to 1-2 plugins/themes but including private repos) and offering both **recurring and one-time payment options**. Most of the others only have a subscription which I hate. I'd rather pay a one-time fee.
* **What‚Äôs the best way to share it with the community?** Should I go all in on the WordPress marketplace, or are there other avenues I should explore?

I‚Äôm also looking for **beta testers**, so if this sounds like something you‚Äôd use, let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy to share the full version with you for free.

webdev,"Stream Postgres changes to AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub in real-time","Hey all,

We just added AWS SQS and GCP Pub/Sub support to Sequin. I'm a big fan of both systems so I'm very excited about this release. Check out the quickstarts here:

* [https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/sqs](https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/sqs)
* [https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/gcp-pubsub](https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/gcp-pubsub)

**What is Sequin?**

Sequin is an open source tool for change data capture (CDC) in Postgres. Sequin makes it easy to stream Postgres rows and changes to streaming platforms and queues (e.g. SQS, Pub/Sub, Kafka):

[https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin)

**Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub**

So, you can backfill all or part of a Postgres table into SQS or Pub/Sub. Then, as inserts, updates, and deletes happen, Sequin will send those changes as JSON messages to your SQS queue or Pub/Sub topic in real-time.

**FIFO consumption**

We have full support for FIFO/ordered consumption. By default, we group/order messages by the source row's primary key (so if \`order\` \`id=1\` changes 3 times, all 3 change events will be strictly ordered). This means your downstream systems can know they're processing Postgres events in order.

For SQS FIFO queues, that means setting `MessageGroupId`. For Pub/Sub, that means setting the `orderingKey`.

You can set the `MessageGroupId`/`orderingKey` to any combination of the source row's fields.

**What can you build with Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub?**

* **Event-driven workflows**: For example, triggering side effects when an order is fulfilled or a subscription is canceled.
* **Replication**: You have a change happening in Service A, and want to fan that change out to Service B, C, etc. Or want to replicate the data into another database or cache.
* **Kafka alt:** One thing I'm really excited about is that if you combine a Postgres table with SQS or Pub/Sub via Sequin, you have a system that's comparable to Kafka. Your Postgres table can hold historical messages/records. When you bring a new service online (in Kafka parlance, consumer group) you can use Sequin to backfill all the historical messages into that service's SQS queue or Pub/Sub Topic. So it makes these systems behave more like a stream, and you get to use Postgres as the retention layer.

**Example**

You can setup a Sequin sink easily with [sequin.yaml](https://sequinstream.com/docs/reference/sequin-yaml#sequin-yaml) (a lightweight Terraform ‚Äì Terraform support coming soon!)

Here's an example of an SQS sink:

    # sequin.yaml
    databases:
      - name: ""my-postgres""
        hostname: ""your-rds-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com""
        database: ""app_production""
        username: ""postgres""
        password: ""your-password""
        slot_name: ""sequin_slot""
        publication_name: ""sequin_pub""
        tables:
          - table_name: ""orders""
            sort_column_name: ""updated_at""
    
    sinks:
      - name: ""orders-to-sqs""
        database: ""my-postgres""
        table: ""orders""
        batch_size: 1
        # Use order_id for FIFO message grouping
        group_column_names: [""id""]
        # Optional: only stream fulfilled orders
        filters:
          - column_name: ""status""
            operator: ""=""
            comparison_value: ""fulfilled""
        destination:
          type: ""sqs""
          queue_url: ""https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/orders-queue.fifo""

webdev,Is Programmatic Review Flagging Possible via Google API?,"Hi,

I work for a marketing company that manages multiple businesses, and one of my responsibilities is flagging Google reviews that breach Google's policies and following up with Google based on the outcome.

The main challenge is that this is a manual process‚Äîwe have to log in to each client account and perform this task individually. I‚Äôve noticed that some other platforms offer a dashboard where users can flag specific reviews and receive feedback on Google‚Äôs response regarding those reviews. If Google‚Äôs reply is negative, these platforms allow users to provide additional information through the same dashboard to support their reason for flagging the review.

I know this process can be done manually via a business‚Äôs Google My Business (GMB) account and the Google Reviews Management Tool to submit more information for a review. However, I‚Äôve searched extensively and can‚Äôt find any information in the Google API that would enable the above scenario programmatically.

I've always had a native-firsts stance, so I haven't needed a cross-platform solution for a while so i am a bit out of date on the current state of affairs, so i'd like any constructive feedback

I'm currently considering:

- flutter
- kotlin compose/native
- nativescript

My thoughts so far:

**Flutter**

Pros: 

- I've always loved flutter from the pre-beta version
- Their rendering model is very interesting
- Dart is perfectly boring in the best sense of the way. It is familiar whether you're coming from java, javascript, or some other algol-inspired language. it can be quickly adopted by other developers in an afternoon or so
- It is a very opinionated language which eliminates unnecessary conversations about how to do things
- Their web output is finally stable


Cons: 

- State management and design patterns have been questionable in the past and change often. 
- Using canvas for the web output feels icky but that's a knee-jerk reaction and they seem to have addressed accessibility issues

**kotlin**

Pros: 

- Jetbrains understands developer needs and have vastly improved the android ecosystem. 
- Kotlin fixes java and is a fun language

Cons: 

- Kotlin has a large learning curve for new devs because there are so many features. 
- Web and iOS are not yet to a stable state

**nativescript**

Pros:

- It seems robust and stable
- It supports many FE tools

Cons:

- I have no experience with it


**Things i've ruled out (but can be convinced otherwise)**

- ionic

    };

I also have the other CRUD functions and they are working perfectly, but when it comes to updating a client and clicking the modify button, A server error 500 keeps logging on my console and nothing is updated. 

This is how I'm handling the form submit: 

    const handleSubmit = async (e) =&gt; {
        e.preventDefault();
    
        console.log(formData);
    
        try {
          const response = await fetch(""http://localhost:8080/api/clients"", {
            method: ""POST"",
            headers: {
              ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(formData),
          });
    
          const data = await response.json();
    
          if (response.ok) {
            MessageToast(data.message);
            onSubmit(formData);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
        }
      };

    const router = express.Router();
    
    const {

    module.exports = router;

    app.use((err, req, res, next) =&gt; {
      console.error(err.stack);

webdev,"High-level architecture of my point-of-sales app (Vue, IndexedDB, Electron &amp; React Native + Laravel)","I've been building a point-of-sales app that works on iPads, Android devices and Windows systems, and I drew up a high-level architecture diagram to show you.

At the core sits a Vue SPA, that gets wrapped in:

* Electron for Windows/MacOS builds
* React Native for Android and iOS builds

[High-level architecture of our POS app](https://preview.redd.it/n3s58yejau5e1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6912edbafd36ace6bfe35d1c68efeb39de887fbf)

Both the React Native app, and the Electron app have a shared NodeJS component, that allows the SPA to communicate with devices on the network using TCP for example.

This way, our app can communicate with peripherals like thermal printers and payment terminals.

Since React Native doesn't come with a NodeJS runtime, we ship [NodeJS mobile](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/) with it, and this entire setup allows me to share \~95% of my entire codebase for all platforms.

webdev,Questions about interfacing with OAuth and Azure,"Hey all! Will be posting this to an Azure subreddit too, but since half of the problem is mine as a dev, thought somebody here might be able to help...

For the past 3 years, have been providing single sign-on to a site I run for a client who uses Azure for their employee logins. That was a big learning curve for me as a dev (first work with Azure SSO), but it's been going great since. The expiry for the original certificates is coming up quickly, though, and the closer we get the more I feel like rollover is a situation of ""the blind leading the blind"". Hoping somebody here might have experience from the admin and developer side and be able to provide some perspective.

My understanding is that the usual rollover goes like this... They add a new cert with a later expiry, and add it as a secondary in Azure. They send it my way (they sent it in an XML document). When I'm set, I swap out the old cert for the new, things for the site continue unabated, and once everything's stable they can make the new cert primary and delete the old.

It appears that on their end they've only got ""active/inactive"" for certs, though. They're saying that I can't use the new cert while it's inactive, and activating the new one will deactivate the current one. Apparently they usually do the switch with a scheduled, simultaneous change on both ends. That sounds nuts to me.

So, first question is am I missing something here? I'd be happy to support their system by keeping a primary and fallback cert on my end, and trying the fallback if the primary fails, but in that case could use a little guidance on what going to a fallback looks like for OAuth (in particular, how to deal with the fact that trying the primary I believe consumes the authorization code). Any resources would be greatly appreciated.

Second question... When we started this whole thing the admin on their end had me send a PFX including the certificate for the key we're signing the client assertion with. That will also be expiring soon, so I assumed I'd need to get a new cert to them as well. They're saying there's no ""spot"" for that and they don't think they need an updated certificate.

webdev,Is it possible to repeatedly click a static button to show social media videos?,"[https://CaneFreestyle.com](https://CaneFreestyle.com) allows users to click the home page and see cane videos randomly.

PROBLEM:

The user clicks the home page, watches a random link, and must navigate back to the home page.

Sites like Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube pages contain have Javascript that breaks frames.

They also detect if their page is embedded in frames and prevent their page from displaying.

Worse, if the mobile apps are installed, the user is redirected to see the link in the app.

SOLUTION:

I would like to change the website so that:

1. he user can click a button that does not move
2. the user can click the button repeatedly
3. each time they click, they see a random video
4. the site avoids violating the terms of services
5. it works using frontend Javascript, HTML, &amp; CSS

It will be nicer if the user can simply ***click one button repeatedly*** and see random links.

Is there a way to make it so that the user can watch 100 videos only by clicking 100 times?",DealDeveloper,1haqsp0,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haqsp0/is_it_possible_to_repeatedly_click_a_static/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haqsp0/is_it_possible_to_repeatedly_click_a_static/,2024-12-10 01:58:56,0,0.2,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haqsp0
webdev,Ecommerce choice for almost 500k monthly visitors?,"Hey, I am currently in process of building a rather heavy ecommerce that will have a lot of features ( including all normal ecommerce features such as shipping, stock management, order status types, user registration, loyalty features etc). And I will likely need something really strong and customizable, I will also need something that I can go headless route which will allow me to decouple front from back.

Shipping and order management should be something I can fully customize though (like offer free shipping after a certain amount, set order status to what shipping method is used).

There will also be recurring payments, which will be monthly, bi weekly or weekly depending on user package (they will be just a small part of the shop though, I can set the recurring payments via stripe or paypal if needed).

Shop will be operating in Europe and will likely end up being a multi store type shop (different for every country it will operate in, not many countries max 4).

So far I have checked out Shopify Plus, Shopware 6, Medusajs etc.

Shopify Plus while good doesn't really seem to fit the criteria for my project considering client doesn't want to pay monthly for addons and such so I've ruled it out. 

I did look at Medusajs but to be honest it seems like it lacks so many features out of box that most shops have, it lacks category nesting (based on what I have seen) which is something I really need to have.

Shopware 6 to me seems like a good choice, since it is customizable enough for it to work for me and headless seems like a good enough option for it. 

I have ruled out some things like Woocommerce (too slow and can't rely on its security), Magento 2 (too much dev time) and PrestaShop.

My question is, is there anything better and faster considering project scope than Shopware 6? 

Thank you very much for reading.

Edit: I do have the option of going for custom solution backend which is indeed likely the best choice when it comes to this project?

webdev,Resources to learn about images,"Greetings, 

After just making a super basic SPA I found working regards to images to be quite frustrating. I am familiar with the myriad of devices and screen sizes that need to be accommodated, but I am quite rusty. I am now thinking that for my portfolio I should start with a few websites that dont even have subjects in their images, but instead are just big colored X's that pertain to a certain image size so I can get the hang of this again. Thats practical right? I am rediscovering how switching from one content pane with images, to another with form inputs, will expand and contract the parent container and I need to revisit my understanding on this topic. 

On the other hand, I was also wondering if anyone knows of any resources or tutorials that do a deep focus on web development with respect to working with just images? It would be nice to learn more about how the web isnt all JPG, PNGs, SVGs, anymore, and whatever else has changed over the last 4 years since I have been in school. I did a search on this forums but I didnt find any resources that truly focused on this subject with great emphasis. 

Backstory- I used to manage a PHP/HTML/CSS/JQuery/WP website for a medium sized non-profit before COVID shutdown the company. I went back to school to earn a degree, landed a backend dev job, but then that company started hemorrhaging money and I am now seeking to go into Full Stack development by making a portfolio of projects using React/Node with BS5.

I haven't used EF Core before. my company uses old school Stored procedures etc in SSMS. I'm looking forward to it!

then I'm going to build another one and follow

so I got the local web server working with my SQL SERVER too! it was super fun and easy to implement. been cruising by with the project so far. she is actively using it on her phone while she cooks. 

next portion is to the make fully local app for fun.

My fiance' wants a cookbook application that will also need a simple SQL database.  
I know how to create it, but we're wanting more of a local App without the need of internet connections.

so using visual studio, is there a way i can create a web app using [ASP.Net](http://ASP.Net) Core and use some local database inside the app? I know i can simply write data to XML files, but I'd rather sort of use SQL.

webdev,"First Month Update - $6K in revenue, here is what I learned","Hey fellow web developers,

Hope you‚Äôre all doing amazing! I wanted to share a bit about what the past month has been like for me.

I'm pretty sure you are all familiar with my product - ChatGPT Toolbox, I posted about it here before, But in case you missed it, it‚Äôs a Chrome extension designed to supercharge your ChatGPT experience. It bridges all the gaps and adds tons of useful features, like creating folders, pinning chats, saving and reusing prompts, exporting conversations, and even downloading messages as MP3 files with 9 different voice options. And that‚Äôs just scratching the surface‚Äîthere are plenty more cool tools packed in!

you can read more about it here:

www.ai-toolbox.co

 Last Saturday marks a full month since my extension officially became a paid product, and wow, what a ride it‚Äôs been. It‚Äôs been a month packed with lessons, challenges, and a few wins that I‚Äôm really proud of. To celebrate hitting 5,500 users and $6,000 in revenue in just the first month, I wanted to share 5 big lessons I‚Äôve learned along the way.

1Ô∏è‚É£ A great product isn‚Äôt enough.
This one hit me hard. You can have the most amazing product ever, but if you can‚Äôt clearly explain its value to people, it‚Äôs not going anywhere. I had to work on really understanding what my audience needed and how to communicate that effectively.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing isn‚Äôt optional.
Honestly, I thought the product would ""sell itself"" at first. Big mistake. Even if it‚Äôs great, no one will buy it if they don‚Äôt know it exists. Marketing has been a steep learning curve for me, but I‚Äôve realized just how critical it is to make some noise about your product.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer support = magic.
I answered 97% of customer emails within 3 minutes (the other 3%? I was asleep üòÖ). People were blown away by the quick responses. If email didn‚Äôt solve their issue, I jumped on a Google Meet with them. The reaction was always the same: pure shock and gratitude. Those moments reminded me how much a little extra effort can make a huge difference.

4Ô∏è‚É£ I shine in live interactions, not on social media.
I was invited to present my extension in front of 700 people during a webinar, and it was such a rush. People loved it, and the feedback I got afterward was unreal.

What stood out to me, though, was that I connect much better with people live than through social media. Whenever I try posting videos or updates, they don‚Äôt seem to land the same way. But when I‚Äôm live? That‚Äôs where I thrive. Definitely something I‚Äôll need to figure out moving forward.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Organic growth is the real MVP.
Every single user so far has come from organic traffic. I hired a marketing agency to help scale, but honestly, they haven‚Äôt brought in even one new customer yet. It‚Äôs frustrating, but I‚Äôm staying patient.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been focusing on rolling out cool new features. I have about 70,000 ideas buzzing in my head ü§Ø, and this month, I pushed out updates like crazy. I just ran a quick poll in my community, and the top-voted feature was live within 24 hours. That was such a fun win!

So, what‚Äôs next?
I‚Äôve realized that for my next product, I really need to build a personal brand to make this process easier. But that‚Äôs easier said than done‚Äîwhat language do I use? what platform? Still trying to figure that out.

It‚Äôs been a wild month, and I feel like things are just getting started.

webdev,Help needed - Embassy Appointment ,"Need help

Hello,
I have been trying to get a germany study visa appointment for the last six months. All the appointments get taken in a few seconds. I have tried everything. I had to defer my semester and now the deadline is going to pass again. 
The problem is that there is a server side limit of 3 seconds before which you can't submit the captcha and appointment form. Considering this limit, the earliest you can submit the form after the appointments are open is 4 seconds (one second to click the appointment slot, open the form and fill it; and 3 seconds wait before the submission). I have many a times clicked the submit button at exactly the 4 second mark, but still no luck . 
I was told that there are some people who have somehow bypassed this limit and they can submit the form and captcha from the client side before the 3 second limit. They book all the appointments. 
I don't know if this is true. But if someone can confirm this or help me, i would be eternally grateful.

webdev,How can I improve my PHP/Web development workflow as a solo hobbyist?,"I'm developing a PHP/MySQL application, for frontend assets I'm using NPM (node-sass) to compile/minimise SCSS and Javascript.

**My current setup:**

OS: Windows 10

Dev environment (Laragon):

PHP 8.2.5

MySQL 8.0.30

Editor: VS Code

Command line tools:

Git

Composer

NPM

FTP: WinSCP

Host: Cloudways

**Development workflow:**

I've created a sub-folder in my Laragon www folder which I've initialised with Git. I've also initialised some assets folders with SCSS and javascript to compile with node-sass so I run the command npm run css:watch which compiles the css on every save to my SCSS.

To get in the flow I have to -

1 - Start up my PC (I turn it off every night)

2 - Open windows terminal from my toolbar

3 - CD into my main folder which would be in laragon, e.g. C:\\laragon\\www\\test-app

4 - Type ""code ."" to open the project in vs code

5 - Make changes to my code then open WinSCP and then manually FTP the file to my staging site to test.

**Issues:**

The biggest slowdown is DB schema changes as I add features. I have to make the exact same DB changes to my staging and then live applications. Transferring files across is kind of easy but it would be much easier to be developing on my local machine with exactly the same environment as my live host and then be able to just push all changes to my live host without affecting the live data.

How can I improve my workflow? I'd love to have it so that as soon as I save a file it reloads my browser to reflect the changes instantly and then quickly deploy any changes to my database or files to my staging site and then to my live site after testing.",AberrantNarwal,1h9l6sm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h9l6sm/how_can_i_improve_my_phpweb_development_workflow/,2024-12-08 15:27:46,3,1.0,3,0,9,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h9l6sm

webdev,Offering financing to clients,"Own a digital agency and IT consultancy. 

Something I've thought about for a while is offering finance options to clients. For example, if an ecommerce site costs ¬£30,000, they could put down a deposit and spread the cost, say ¬£1000 a month for 36 months (subject to credit check). Clients wouldn't gain ownership of anything until it is paid off entirely.

Another alternative is potentially leasing whereby we include maintenance and hosting but the monthly is indefinite. They'd commit to a minimum time period and keep paying after this to keep the site active or start again and rebuild. 

Changes outside of the agreement would be billed at ""x"" amount extra for the remaining agreement months. 

Could offer this by partnering with a bank/broker potentially. Contracts would have to be watertight. 

Drawback - debts die with the company if it folds unless we enforce a personal guarantee. 

Thoughts?

Many of the devs on these projects are obviously jr. trying to get real world experience under their belt. The problem is, most of these non-profit folks can't see how over their head these devs are. They lack problem solving skills, systems thinking abilities, and professionalism. Often deadlines are missed, they're late or no-show meetings, and they have basic technical problems they struggle to resolve. I try my best to help where I can, but I just don't have the desire to overstep beyond my commitment.

webdev,Consulting on a web dev niche technology vs overall web dev services?,"Hi all,

I am in the process of spinning up my own consulting / development shop and I am stumped on one thing and I would appreciate some advice from the group...

Should I focus my consultancy on the niche technology that I know very well (MyNicheTechConsulting.com) and only do work in that tech / framework, or should I broaden out to do whatever people need and will pay me for?

There is a part of me that thinks that focusing on the niche will pay off down the road, and that doing overall tech consulting will find me building wordpress sites for people, competing against every other firm on the planet.

That said, I hate to leave money on the table and if a potential customer needs X, Y, or Z I should be willing to provide X, Y, and Z.

I am asking this question mostly in the context of what services do I list that I offer on my website. I CAN do X, Z, or Z but part of me thinks 'marketing specialization"" on the website would pay off in the long term.

webdev,Tracking order section in a wordpress website ? ,"I am creating a website using WordPress. Basically as for now, the website is free and I am also using WooCommerce in the website. I am not a web developer. I don't have much knowledge. I am just building a website through WordPress and WooCommerce with the basic knowledge im getting through tutorials from here and there.

So my question is that I want to add a tracking service to my website. I am not sure of which delivery service will be used later. The question is that if I add a tracking order section into my website and the section includes the customer to add a tracking ID or whatever tracking data that the user enters, is it supposed to lead to the delivery service's own platform on which they can track the order? Is there any coding or plugins involved in such a thing if I want to include it into my website?
Or how does this whole process of creating such a tracking section goes on about? Any help would be really appreciated since I have zero knowledge about web development as a whole. :)

webdev,"Help! P2P Video Call App with React, Express, and Socket.io - Remote Stream Not Working","Hi all,

I'm building a P2P video call app using React, Express, and Socket.io. I've gone through several articles and tutorials, and I believe my setup is close to working, but I'm running into an issue. Everything seems to be functioning well, but I'm not receiving the remote video stream. There are no errors in the console, but the remote video doesn't display.

# Setup:

* **React** on the frontend for UI and WebRTC implementation.
* **Express** and **SocketIO** on the backend to handle signaling and peer connections.
* **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication (using STUN server for ICE).

# Logs:

From the server logs, I see that the peer IDs are being set successfully, and messages are being passed between peers.

Logs from Server: 

    [2024-12-08T08:34:19.378Z] Received message of type 'setPeerId' from Ub0_7yT_57X6Ngd7AAAS

    [2024-12-08T08:34:23.419Z] Received message of type 'candidate' from two_2x42mksyr6v

As you can see, the peers are getting connected correctly, but the remote video stream isn't showing up on the client-side.

# Steps I've Tried:

* Ensured that the remote video element is being updated with the incoming stream.
* Checked that the RTC connection is correctly handling the tracks.
* Verified that the signaling messages (offer, answer, and candidates) are being sent and received properly.

# My Question:

Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this issue? Why isn‚Äôt the remote video stream displaying, and what could I be missing in the WebRTC setup?

Any help is appreciated!

webdev,Framework for desktop-like approach to developing web applications?,"I'm an engineer in a classical sense, I work with signal processing equipment, system integration, and also implement and manage corporate infrastructure. I'm not a web developer by trade, and¬†*have no such aspirations*. I do however occasionally write specialized utilities for the business.

I wish to ask for a very specific thing. I would like a framework that would allow me to develop applications that will display in a web browser, developed in a desktop application manner, meaning not like traditional web development with separation of front-end and backend, separated by an API. I would like my application code to be monolithic and application be ""rendered"" on the server. In other words,¬†**I do not wish to (read: must not) write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, that should be handled by the framework.

**I found one such example:**

[**Webswing Demo**](https://prototype.webswing.org/webswing-demo/)

This is pretty much perfect, I'm very proficient in Java and Swing. But. My company will likely not adopt Java, and Java runtime.

**Are there other examples of this type of framework? How about something for scripting languages, like Python or PHP? Is there something like this for .NET?**

I have a much better chance of adopting something if the webserver prerequisites come from official RHEL packages repos (CentOS/Rocky/Alma). My company avoids 3rd-party stuff for security reasons.

webdev,DON'T BUY DOMAINS FROM GODADDY!!!! SCAM!!!!!,"I recently had a terrible experience with GoDaddy, and I feel compelled to warn others about their unethical and exploitative practices. 

Here's the list what they do (according to what i observed so far)  :-

1. **Deceptive Domain Availability**: When I searched for a domain, it was initially shown as cheap and available. However, shortly afterward, it was claimed as unavailable, marked as a ""premium domain,"" and priced ridiculously high.
2. **GoDaddy Monopolizes Domains**: I noticed that every domain I searched for was suddenly ""claimed"" by GoDaddy. Visiting these domains leads to their landing page, where they sell the domain at inflated prices or suggest hiring a broker‚Äîessentially forcing users to overpay for domains they initially showed as affordable.
3. **WHOIS Confirms Suspicious Practices**: When I checked WHOIS information for one of the domains, here‚Äôs what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/meuivvga995e1.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51bcfc6eddabc92886686167d641e4309cbcea13

4. It‚Äôs clear that GoDaddy is holding these domains through their proxy service, making them unavailable to regular users unless they pay a premium

5. **Unfair Market Manipulation**: GoDaddy is deliberately creating scarcity by claiming domains people search for and reselling them at inflated prices. This is not just unethical; it‚Äôs exploitative and undermines trust in domain registration services.

üí° **What You Can Do**:

* Avoid GoDaddy at all costs! Use alternative domain registrars like Namecheap, Hostinger, Cloudflare or Porkbun.
* Be cautious when searching for domains, as GoDaddy seems to track interest and manipulate availability to force you to pay more.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Conclusion**:  
GoDaddy‚Äôs practices are a blatant scam, designed to exploit users searching for domains. They manipulate the market to extort money and provide no transparency in the process. Stay away from GoDaddy and use trustworthy alternatives instead!

this happen for all the domain i checked specially (.com) all the one also don't say .com are popular in demand then why it available and now its register then why now and why after i checked and why all and why all the domain are directing to godaddy not once to their registered owners website

here the live proof:

of course:) i know u say what premium in godaddy visit page look like

see they are telling to buy at high price it's okay this premium one i don't want but why do they claim anonymously the domain after i looked or searched on their website in one day even after 3 months the domain does not have a website only godaddy promotion this is for all domains i looked into",Invincible-Bug,1h85tfm,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h85tfm/dont_buy_domains_from_godaddy_scam/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h85tfm/dont_buy_domains_from_godaddy_scam/,2024-12-06 16:51:46,975,0.92,975,0,543,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h85tfm

webdev,Do you know where i can find a solid Full Stack Pre-built Chat App? (next.js &amp; shadcn),"Hey everyone!
I‚Äôm working on a chat app built with Next.js/Supabase/Shadcn (Tailwind + Radix), and currently, the UI is built from scratch, using Supabase (with their websocket). 
It works, but I‚Äôm looking for something more solid in terms of both backend and frontend (logic and UI)

‚ÄîFRONTEND‚Äî
I‚Äôm searching for a library or package that:
- Provides a ready-to-use and robust UI for a chat app (paid options are totally fine).
- Handles common behaviors efficiently, like:
1. Fetching older messages while keeping the scroll position intact
2. Auto-scroll to the bottom when a new message arrives
3. Maybe even built-in gestures or animations to improve the UX.
- It's highly customizable, similar to shadcn: I want to copy/paste components into my project and have the freedom to tweak them directly, rather than being tied to a rigid external library.

‚ÄîBACKEND‚Äî
If it's already related to the package/library it would be great, otherwise if you have any valid alternative to the Supabase architecture with their websocket please let me know

Do you have any recommendations or experience with something like this?

webdev,The Google Calendar API is getting on my nerves...,"So I use ClickUp as my task management tool and Google Calendar to organize my day. I wanted to view all my daily tasks on my calendar and the inbuilt GCal integration that comes with ClickUp is buggy. So, being a developer I decided to put my skills to use.

I wrote a script that fetches all my open tasks from ClickUp that have a start date or a due date. It then fetches all my existing events from GCal. All the tasks fetched from ClickUp are created as events on GCal. The previously fetched events from GCal are all then deleted. This runs as a CRON every one hour on AWS Lambda (once an hour to stay within the free tier of AWS, ClickUp and Google APIs)

This runs flawlessly for a few hours after which the Google Calendar API that fetches all events from the calendar starts returning 0 events even though I have existing events on the calendar. As a result, older tasks don't get deleted from the calendar and I now have more than 20 duplicates of each task on my calendar.

Weirdly enough, if I delete the calendar and create a new one and pass the new calendar ID it again starts working flawlessly. This lasts for a few hours after which the same thing starts happening again. The Google Calendar API starts returning 0 events even though there are existing events. 

I am at my wit's end. Anyone else ever encountered this?

webdev,Should modals be generated by javascript or should they be in the HTML and fed values from the javascript?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a high school student and a newbie full-stack developer working on building a website. Right now, my approach for modals is to define them in the HTML and then feed them values dynamically from my JavaScript when needed.

However, I recently came across a post that suggested it‚Äôs better to generate modals entirely with JavaScript instead of having them pre-defined in the HTML.

Whats the best practice here? Should I stick with my current method, or would switching to dynamically generating modals with JavaScript be a better choice? 

Ty in advance!

webdev,Is my text too hard to read? Personal blog website,"Looking for feedback from people, I built a personal blog page and was wondering if my text is too hard to read?

Talking about this site of mine, the contents of the blog posts: [https://bryanhogan.com/blog](https://bryanhogan.com/blog)

I know that there are some optimizations that I could do to improve readability, but do people actually notice that? Like:  

- Reduce font weight - Often white text on black background has a perceived stronger font weight than black text on a white background.
- Allow for a light and dark mode toggle. (Dark and light mode toggle definitely would help some people, but how many, is it worth the time implementing it?)
- Reduce brightness of text - Text too bright on a dark background may be harder to read.

Do you think these changes could actually help here?

webdev,Feedback wanted,"Hey everyone! 

I‚Äôve been working on a fun project called [whothatpokemon.com](https://whothatpokemon.com) which is just a browser based game inspired by the iconic ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs That Pok√©mon?‚Äù challenge. I mainly built it as I'm looking to eventually teach others how to code and wanted a project that can be enjoyable to build. I know this has been done before in this community and I've added my own sort of twist to it. You can compete against friends online to see who can guess the most correctly. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes (currently limited to 1 on 1 matches).

I‚Äôd love to get your feedback on any of these areas:

* Gameplay: Is it fun and engaging? Is it too easy? I let my cousin who is a Pok√©mon fanatic a try and had to take the phone away from him because he was guessing them all too easily lol.
* Design: I tried to keep this area as cleaned up as possible but I'm also not a designer so it was a bit hard to be creative in this aspect.
* Features: What could make it better or more exciting?
* Bugs: If you run into anything that's not supposed to happen, please let me know. It also hasn't had any users yet since this is the first time mentioning it, so I was hoping this could be some sort of stress test as well.

  
I‚Äôm open to any ideas to improve the game or even expand on it (like leaderboards, new modes, or generation specific challenges).

If you do have some spare time please check it out, and let me know what you think. I‚Äôd really appreciate your input as I work on making it better.

I‚Äôm looking to build a website focused on engineering content, with lots of notes, equations, and visual content (graphs/images). My goal is to make navigation between pages *super fast*.

# My Experience

* I‚Äôve worked with static and dynamic site generators like Astro.js, Gatsby, and Next.js.
* I‚Äôve built single- and a few-page websites before but nothing too big yet.

# What I‚Äôm Thinking

* **Content Type:** The site will have lots of equations (thinking LaTeX in Markdown for simplicity and readability) and visual content like graphs and images.
* **Speed:** Priority is speed, especially when loading pages.
* **Approach:** Considering Astro.js for a fully static site to keep things fast, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

# Questions:

1. Is LaTeX rendered in Markdown a good approach for displaying equations? Any better options?
2. For images and graphs, what‚Äôs the most efficient way to handle them while keeping performance in mind (e.g., CDN, image formats like WebP)?
3. Should I consider other frameworks or approaches besides Astro.js for this use case?

Would love any advice or insights from people who‚Äôve worked on similar projects!

Hey everyone üëã

After struggling with spreadsheets and scattered receipts while reporting to funders (mainly Innovate UK), I built GrantKeeper - a simple tool to help UK organisations manage their grant expenses and reporting.

It lets you:

* Upload and organize receipts/invoices
* Automated data extraction
* Track expenses and automatically handle currency conversion
* Export Excel with all your data and files
* Collaborate with team members on financial reporting

I've already worked with others receiving grants and it's turned a task which typically takes weeks into hours (and I want to make it better!)

I'm curious how others currently handle their expense tracking? Are you using spreadsheets, accounting software, or some other solution? Have you tried other specialised tools, and if so, what was your experience?

I know similar stuff exists, but in this case I've decided to start by targeting a niche before thinking about expanding it for more general use cases.

webdev,Meet CSSformalize: Simplify Your Form Styling Workflow,"Hi¬†[r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)!

Styling HTML forms can often feel like navigating a minefield. Achieving consistency across various states‚Äîsuch as active or focus‚Äîrequires meticulous attention to detail. It's all too easy to miss a crucial style or struggle with the myriad of browser-specific prefixes like -webkit- or -moz-. This complexity can turn what should be a straightforward task into a tedious chore. Recognizing these challenges, I was motivated to create a solution that streamlines the entire process.

Thus, CSSformalize was born‚Äîa comprehensive open-source CSS framework designed to transform the way native HTML forms are styled. By leveraging CSSformalize, developers can effortlessly generate elegant and consistent form elements. This framework eliminates the need to memorize complex styles or write repetitive CSS code, offering a much-needed shortcut for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike.

webdev,"Your first project, from a business owner's perspective","I recently decided to start my own online bakery. Because I have a background in programming, I also decided to make the website myself. After completing most of it, I realized that what I had learned would be valuable to people starting off. Often it is the case that new web developers aren't sure where to start. They aren't sure what kind of a project would look good to show potential employers. The following is a list of things I ended up needing for my site, each of which would be excellent things to code.

Order submit form.  
‚Ä¢ Layout: I started out using a column design. It looked great on my PC, but once I switched to my phone, it was a garbled mess. First lesson: make sure your design works for everyone.  
‚Ä¢ Updating totals: Whenever the user changes the number of ordered items from 1 to 2, update the subtotal. Take into consideration shipping and tax as well. Know what event to trigger this on. There is onchange and oninput, for example. Users are often able to bypass these triggers when they copy and paste data in. Know how to deal with that.  
‚Ä¢ Restrict input: Should it only be numbers? Only letters? Only a certain length? Restrict it. Learn how to use regex also. It's scary at first, but it is powerful.  
‚Ä¢ Autocomplete, required, and read-only attributes: Sometimes autocomplete ends up making your site look tacky; it makes a dropdown field appear and that can be confusing for some users. Other times, it's handy to use. Know when to use it and when not to. Fields like subtotal, shipping, taxes, and total should be read-only.  
‚Ä¢ Pricing: Have a single, small file that contains pricing information if you have a small site, and source this into your order page. Price figures will be used in too many places to have you going through and updating the numbers everywhere manually - they are displayed next to the products and used in the equations to calculate pricing. Having them in a small file greatly simplifies things. Obviously if it's for a large site, use a database.  
‚Ä¢ The backend: Don't trust user input. There are various ways to screen it to avoid SQL injections depending on the language you are using. Everything you did on the front end you need to do again on the backend, and more, concerning checking that number inputs are numbers, that inputs aren't too long, that email addresses are in fact email addresses (there is a regex for this), etc.  
‚Ä¢ Database: Insert the order into a database to save it. You will learn about the different kinds of fields like int, tiny int, date, and datetime. You will learn what specific format is acceptable for something like datetime as well.  
‚Ä¢ Invoice: Once complete, you should show an invoice to the customer, detailing everything that was selected. Showing invoices is actually part of the Visa guidelines, which business owners will care about if they are accepting credit card transactions. Taking this a step further, you can also figure out how to automatically email the invoice to them without too much trouble.

Payment  
‚Ä¢ Composer: Know how to use this, as many payment gateways will have you install their payment SDK this way. Know that there can be issues with trying to install it through shell access from an ftp client. It's more ideal through the terminal on your server.  
‚Ä¢ Payment Gateways: Look at the developer guides for various payment gateways like Stripe, [Authorize.net](http://Authorize.net), and Elavon. It's also a good idea to explore their customer service, as some of them are absolute garbage. Some of them have code for Ruby, PHP, C#, etc, but others will not have one or the other. Some will have SDK's that are so out of date that they expect developers to edit the code themselves. Read the comments on the github pages to see what people are saying about it.  
‚Ä¢ PCI Compliance: Understand the different levels of PCI Compliance, specifically SAQ A, SAQ A-EP, and SAQ D. Try to spot if the payment gateway specifically states what level of PCI Compliance you can achieve using one of their methods. If I had any advice to give here, it would be this: SAQ D is a significant step up and requires a lot of time, money, and effort to achieve. Stick to the easier ones. Lastly, do NOT have any CC data hit your server. The payment gateway should give you a nonce to use instead or take you to an entirely different payment page on their servers.  
‚Ä¢ CC guidelines: Look at the Visa, Mastercard, and American Express guidelines. They want you to display their logos on CC forms, have specific image files for them, want specific spacing around the logo's, and specific coloration, even for the background in some cases (where their logo would be not as visible). They are even specific about capitalizing the V in Visa, and not having it as all caps: VISA. Some of these guidelines don't absolutely have to be followed, but you may be required to follow some by the agreement you signed with your acquirer, for example. For you, the new student just getting your feet wet, you don't need to go so far as to read the terms and conditions to get all this, but you still can familiarize yourself with the guidelines and attempt to adhere to them. It also offers you the chance to elaborate on what you know about this subject in interviews.  
‚Ä¢ CC spacing: Another thing that comes from the guidelines is the spacing of the numbers in a CC for an input field. 6589756425691215 is difficult to read, but 6589 7564 2569 1215 is much easier to read. Coming up with the code to make this work is a bit tricky as well. With some solutions, using Replace() can alter the caret position, which can be jarring to the user. Copy/pasting can also bypass the event you are trying to wait for. AE cards can have 15 digits instead of 16. Some fancy CC forms also update a logo to the right of the CC number to reflect the kind of card the user is attempting to use. What first seems like a simple form can turn into a completed amount of code.  
‚Ä¢ CC expiration dates: They should be separate - one field for the month, one for the year; limited to numbers only; limited to two digits.  
‚Ä¢ Security field: I believe most are 3 digits long, but AE's is 4.  
‚Ä¢ Luhn algorithm: You can use this to verify if a CC number is typed correctly.  
‚Ä¢ Hide CC: The most ideal way to do this is to have each number of the CC that is typed be briefly visible, then switch it to an asterisk ( \* ). Simply putting the input field type as hidden will not accomplish this. I believe this is also a consideration the CC issuers want you to take, but it's not absolutely required. Always nice if you can achieve it though.

Coupons  
As a coder, you might not think this is that big of a deal, but on the business side of things, you realize this is huge when it comes to Direct Mail. Businesses will want to send out fliers through the mail. Postage is expensive, so you begin to learn about programs like EDDM through the United States Postal Service. This allows businesses to send out many fliers at significantly lower cost. You also learn about paper weights and dimensions for what is acceptable. All of this costs money. It's about $200 to hit 650 residents just for the usps side of things. The actual mailers cost around 20 cents each. As a business owner, you do not want to be blowing all this money to end up with zero new customers. This is where coupons come in. Fliers are the perfect place to put coupons, and so your website then needs to be able to process them as well. Coupons will lessen the chance that your fliers are immediately trashed.  
‚Ä¢ Just like with pricing, have a centralized location where coupon codes can be sourced from to validate them.  
‚Ä¢ You need to display to the user that the coupon code applied. The pricing equation needs to know what to do to account for the reduced price.  
‚Ä¢ Consider how many coupons a user can use in a single transaction.  
‚Ä¢ Consider if that coupon code should be used up or if it's fine to use it with infinite transactions so long as its not expired.  
‚Ä¢ Calculate it on the backend side as well. Have a spot in the database for it so the total price makes sense if you have to investigate a customer order for some reason.  
‚Ä¢ Have a way to remove the coupon discount if they decide they don't want to use it yet.

Security  
Fraudsters will buy millions of card numbers off the dark web, find a website with bad security, then will try to run as many of them through with a $1 charge to see which cards are still good. If you allow users to run millions of cards through, you can not only be subject to thousands of dollars worth of fines, but the credit card issuers will also then view you as a problem. Every incidence of fraud creates a problem for them, so if you are the reason, they can and will bar you from making any future online credit card transactions. Just like that, your business will have gone straight down the toilet.  
‚Ä¢ Log IP's: Every time someone tries to run a transaction through, even if it is unsuccessful, their IP address needs to be logged in a specific table.  
‚Ä¢ Suspension: Once an IP address has exceeded the maximum attempts allowed, that IP address should be suspended for 24 hours from making any transactions at all.  
‚Ä¢ Absolute limits: To prevent IP spoofing, there should also be a limit to how many transactions can be attempted overall for a given time period.  
‚Ä¢ Be careful of setting the field that counts transaction attempts as something like a tiny int. An attacker could continue to attempt transactions, running the number up to 256 where it may roll back over to 1, thereby making the system think that IP address has not exceeded the maximum transaction attempts any more. Then they of course would try to run more credit cards through. Ideally, the transaction counter for a specific IP address should stop counting once that IP address has been suspended to prevent this from happening.  
‚Ä¢ Log IPs first; do the transaction second. Imagine this: an attacker edits a field so that it submits a bad value, causing your page to crash; however, because you have written your code in such a way as to complete the transaction first, they are still able to run millions of cards through to check them, all while avoiding the IP logging part of your code. By logging the IP addresses first however, you lessen the possibility of this occurring.

webdev,Advice for building an app with Cloud Sync?,"Hey everyone,

I'm eyeing a project with Cloud Sync functionality as my next side project. I believe I have the skillset for most of the things the project needs except Cloud Sync, which I have never done before. I have done some googling and collected some articles covering different approaches but I would also like to ask what your recommendations would be for implementing this? 

Here is the project outline:

* Basically, the project will allow users to have an account and store a bunch of data the user enters in their client. This data is synced to all their devices, i e mobile apps and web clients where they have logged into their account.

* You cannot edit data from multiple clients at the same time in real time, but rather work from one client at a time. 

* Users don't have to be able to collaborate on editing the same data, rather each user has their own private data. A future addition might enable other users to see your data, but it's not required for now, and changes don't have to become visible to other users in real time.

* A central server and database keeps track of the data, enables login/auth etc. Probably gonna write this in PHP (Laravel) and postgres unless you tell me this is a bad idea.
* Data is viewed in a mobile app client and stored in a local SQLite database as well for scenarios when they don't have internet. If the user edits data offline, it will be synced the next time they come online. In the future, a web client will be added as well. Will write this in React / React Native because my strongest skillset is in Typescript / React.

* If the user opens another client than the one they're currently on, the current one will disable data entry in favor of the new one (user will be asked if they want to switch) so that they can't try to change the same data from multiple clients at the same time. The only way I have pushed events from a server to clients (in this case, user has opened another client so disable this one) has been with WebSockets but I assume this could be done another way too?

I would assume Cloud Sync can be implemented by adding time stamps to each row of data telling when that row was last edited, and then updating rows that have been edited after the last sync date on that device. Or would it better to pick up a ready made solution for this, and perhaps switch server technology accordingly? For example, if there is a good, readymade solution for Cloud Sync available via NPM I could write the server with express, feathers or what have you instead.

Let's start with Chat GPT and other chat bots that are separated from local data, is the code produced by these bots yours or theirs? Who owns the copyright? If it's theirs can you make enough changes to now own the code?

When it comes to AI integrated into an editor like VS Code, it says in on the VS Code website that your data (i.e your code) will be sent to Microsoft for them to feed into their model. I guess they have to do that to make it work at all, but again what is going on with copyright and security here? Do Microsoft now have access to your entire codebase, API tokens etc and do you have full ownership of the code it helps you write? This seems like a huge level of trust for a commercial non-partner operation to agree to, not to mention obvious security issues.

Are there any local AI models used by code editors that don't send your code to the likes of Microsoft?

webdev,Node or Springboot,"Hi Guys,

I'm thinking of adding a backend for my portfolio website (this is HTML and CSS only). My goal is to have a blog in my portfolio site.

Others said that use the tech stack that you already know. Well I know Angular 17 and Spring Boot for creating side projects.

Then others also said that it is overkill if I use a framework or library (React or Angular) for a simple website with backend (portfolio)

And also, I want to become a Java developer so I searched that most of job postings for Java position need to have knowledge on (HTML, CSS, JS/TS) or (React or Angular).

So what would you recommend?

1. Create the portfolio with vanilla js and node then all the side projects will be React/Angular and Spring boot.
2. Create all side projects with the tech stack Angular/React with Spring boot.


My purpose is to demonstrate or show to interviewer that I am knowledegeable on fundamentals of HTML CSS and JS when I show to them my portfolio.

webdev,"Recently, I have been trying out LLMs for coding and they are surprisingly bad for anything even a tiny bit complex?","Since LLMs (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.) became popular, I have used them for basic things, but only sporadically for coding. Recently, I was entrusted a Vue 3 codebase, and since I didn't know Vue, I thought to myself: Why not get some help from AI? So, I started trying out different models and to my surprise, it's incredible how even basic things such as flexbox in component styling is just too much for them. Anything that has to do with styling, really, that goes beyond ""Set this component's border color to light gray"". If you use Vuetify and custom style classes, then the machine just doesn't WTH is going on anymore. Also, I tried it to make it tell me the difference between React's portals and Vue 3's teleport functionality, and it was disappointing to say the least. The fun became real, though, when I asked it how to teleport a Vue 3 component into a Cytoscape JS node; After 30 minutes or so of back and forth prompting, I gave up, and this is in general how my sessions end: With time wasted, frustration and back at the start of the task.

Other behaviours I have noticed are:

* In the same chat, repeating the same answer to different prompts (this is typical of Mistral), even though you try to nudge it in the right direction by telling it the answer wasn't satisfactory.
* Making up random stuff, e.g., CSS directives or a function's options and then saying ""My bad, you're right. Function x doesn't have the option y"".
* Mixing up versions (e.g., Vue 2 patterns in Vue 3)

... and more.

Honestly, the majority of the time it's useless.

webdev,The Frustration of Front-End Work,"Lately, I've got into front-end again, and during my first project I‚Äôve been feeling completely burned out because of all the planning mistakes that keep coming up. It‚Äôs not even about the coding itself; it‚Äôs those moments when you realize you forgot to plan for something important.

Planning layouts is always like this‚Äîyou can‚Äôt predict every possible scenario for every element. There‚Äôs just too much to think about, and no one‚Äôs brain can handle that much detail at once. Trying to manage all those little things in a scale from 320px to 2880px is exhausting and eats up way too much time and energy.

What‚Äôs worse is that no matter how experienced I am (and I‚Äôve been doing this for about 10 years), no matter what methods or tricks I use, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm improving at handling this chaos.

And then there‚Äôs the issue with designers. If the designer doesn‚Äôt understand how development works, everything falls apart. The project turns into a mess of quick, hacky fixes just to make things work, and after spending hours fixing things, it‚Äôs hard to tolerate the work at all.

To give you a little background, I use sanity as a cms, and my portfolio website directly fetches details from sanity. Now, I have changed the architecture a bit.

I basically want to build a simple web app that runs **locally on my computer on** **windows** with minimal dependencies. I have created the app on linux with a cms before but i wanted to simplify it and make it more portable (ideally just copying the folder, not installing anything).

It queries the wikipedia api and lets the user add things to a list and then edit, filter and sort them smoothly. I also want to be able to add items manually to the list with file uploads and have persistent data storage.

webdev,Which field has the highest demand in freelancing,"Hello friends,

I am a Node.js backend developer with 2 years of experience. I want to start freelancing, but I have no idea how to begin. Based on a friend's suggestion, I created an account on Fiverr and made a simple gig.

My question is: which field has the highest demand in freelancing? I mean fields like frontend, backend development, WordPress, DevOps, data pipelines, data engineering, etc. I want to learn as many skills as possible so that I can set up my own business and avoid working as an employee for a company.

Over the past few months, I have met many people and attended several interviews, some of which were not even related to my field. For example, I gave a data engineering interview where I built an ETL data pipeline using Node.js, Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, and Postgres. I also interacted with companies that develop gambling websites, games, and even crack software to steal user data or bypass paid APIs for WhatsApp and Meta applications.

After working for 2 years, I have realized that most IT companies have middlemen who take a significant cut of the revenue, leaving employees with very little. I want to do something of my own.

I have a few friends who are frontend developers, full-stack developers, and UI/UX designers.

If you have any advice, please share it with me. I‚Äôd like to know what strategies I should use, which platforms I should focus on, etc.

I am not interested in frontend development, and I‚Äôm not good at designing UIs. I prefer backend development and want to explore more opportunities in server-side technologies. Should I explore fields like DevOps or data engineering?

Thank you.

I made a search term management tool that helps you go through the search terms for a campaign so you can find new entries for the negative keywords list.

This is an internal tool that I've build for my own use, and I'm offering it for free, so if it feels unpolished, it's because it is. Should there be interest in it, I'll gladly keep improving it and adding new features.

Although it works just fine without it, it is AI-aided, so if you follow the instructions and the tips on the page, it should give you decent suggestions for negative keywords, which should speed things up quite a bit. It's not perfect, but it made me realize I didn't have a clear delineation in intent for my campaigns. Your mileage may vary.

webdev,Will Authentication always suck?,"The entire web dev scene is  coming to a point where authentication is annoying than ever. Something so simple in concept but the way it is being implemented has frustrated me to a point that I'm writing this because i want to know if it is only me who can't implement proper auth. 

I've used many authentication services across many architectures but in my 3 years of experience I've still not figured out a way or even guidelines that i can follow for implementing authentication across all my applications! Which completely sucks. Authentication is probably the one thing that is keeping me from developing any of my projects which is pretty stupid but if not implemented correctly it poses huge security risks.

  
So I'm writing this to well, maybe discuss what is your approach to authentication. 

  
For context, I'm a full-stack developer (MERN stack) and the problem i encounter is implementing cross-oirigin authentication, many MERN auth videos i see online they either only do it on the frontend or if they are adding auth to both the client and server, that approach is usually not practical or has security risks. I mostly succeed in adding auth to the frontend side, it is securing the backend where i usually screw up.

  
Also when i check the documentation of auth libraries (ex. clerk or next-auth) they lack documentation for client-server architecture and how to secure routes in both frontend and backend. I usually come up with my own route protection system when using any of these but again all types of questions are in my mind. 

**Is this conventional? Is this secure? Is this a good approach?**

  
Again it's not like I've not implemented authentication in a client-server architecture but it's these questions that make me doubt my way of doing things. Anyways would like to know your opinions on this!

webdev,Exploring a faster alternative to dom-accessibility-api: Your thoughts?,"Hi everyone !  


After encountering performance issues with `jsdom` while trying to integrate the [dom-accessibility-api](https://github.com/eps1lon/dom-accessibility-api) library, I started working on a similar library that is potentially faster.

[https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils](https://github.com/rMonell/accessibility-utils)

Having tested the library on some previously heavy tests that could even lead to timeouts, I noticed a performance improvement of about 50% when using my library when retrieving element accessible names. When combined with `happy-dom`, the improvement is even greater.  


Would it be possible for some of you who have experienced similar performance issues to let me know if this library provides any improvements in that regard? Also, feel free to share any feedback on potential issues‚Äîit‚Äôs still a library in development :)

webdev,working with users location,"tldr: ive got an app that asks the user for location and stores in a localstorage but its giving me issues. I'm looking for a write-up or some tips on how to handle users location within a react/next app. 

full story-

i plan on using location throughout the app, so I was planning on using a context. one issue is whether I should ask for location on load, which means any page that gets loaded would ask for users location, even on pages its not needed. for this I could add a second function in my context like fetchLocation and on pages location is needed, if !location fetchLocation. so now I need to check for this every page location is needed?

also, some people don't like to share location. In a way I don't want to bother with them, but I should try to handle this and at least handle it gracefully rather than have the page error. i was considering using an API call to try to get some location from an IP address, or maybe just let people pick a city they'd want to use

the main page for this is an events page that uses location and also can move a map and get lat/lng so there's some logic to change the event location. somewhere in there I'm getting things mixed up and on initial load the maps trying to load without either and erroring. maybe if the first two were worked out I wouldn't fall into this. but I'm clearly doing something out of order. for example when testing in incognito, the page fails as the request to use location is still on the screen.

webdev,Help me choose a stack for my freelance portfolio,"Hi folks,

I'm a freelance dev currently revamping my old portfolio - which doesn't really showcase my skills - and I have trouble choosing a stack for it.

Let me explain:  
I'm a front-end developer with a specialty with CSS / integrations but also a WordPress developer, so I do lots of PHP too. I'm really not used to JS Framework, either front or back end, so I could use this occasion to learn one !  
Since the goal of this website is to present both my front-end and my WordPress services, I'm not sure which way I can go.  
Basically, I've narrowed it down to these four choices :

* **A WordPress with a homemade ACF/Gunterberg theme :** Seems logical since I do lots of WP sites anyway.
* **Just a from scratch HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS website :** Simple enough, I can add a tad of PHP for a contact form. Not even a back-office to add projects, I could to it manually, old-school style.
* **Another CMS like ProcessWire :** An occasion for me to learn some more CMS and not to bother creating a back-office of some sort.
* **Use a JS Framework like Vue.js or React :** I feel way behind modern webdev and I could use a bit of experience. But it might be overkill for a simple portfolio. I could use a boilerplate to have a backoffice/admin and such

Soooo, if I promote among others services, Wordpress dev, it is better to go this way ? Or should I just learn something modern and new ?

webdev,I can't get an Azure function to publish to my Azure account from an Nx monorepo,"The Azure vscode extension scaffolds correct and operations Azure functions but @nxazure/func functions scaffolded in a NX monorepo don't work.

func azure functionapp publish AZURE_FUNCTION_NAME

webdev,Learndash and FluentCRM API related issue ,"Hi folks,

I am running a WordPress site hosted on Rapyd Cloud and the site uses LearnDash as the LMS, FluentCRM for managing email engagement, and WP Fusion for advanced syncing. I also use Uncanny Automator and LearnDash Notifications for additional functionality.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to achieve:

When a student completes a topic in LearnDash, I want to log the completion date in a custom field within FluentCRM for that student.

After 7 or 14 days, I want to check if the student has started the next topic in the course.

If no progress is detected within those two weeks, FluentCRM should trigger an automated email encouraging them to continue.

I‚Äôve written a PHP function using LearnDash‚Äôs hooks and FluentCRM‚Äôs API to update the custom field, but it‚Äôs not working. The completion date isn‚Äôt being stored in FluentCRM, and I‚Äôm unsure if the issue is with the hook, the API call, or something else.

I also reached out to Rapyd Cloud‚Äôs support to check if it might be a server-related issue, but they confirmed it‚Äôs more of an application-level concern and suggested I check with LearnDash or FluentCRM.

Some questions I have:

Is learndash\_topic\_completed the correct hook for this, or is there a better one to use?

Is there a more reliable way to update FluentCRM custom fields programmatically?

For the follow-up, should I consider using WP Fusion‚Äôs tagging features or a cron job for better reliability?

Here are the relevant documentation links I‚Äôve been looking through:

LearnDash Developer Docs

FluentCRM API Docs

WP Fusion Documentation

If anyone has set up something similar or can point out where I might be going wrong, I‚Äôd really appreciate your help! Let me know if you need more details.

webdev,The Rise of AgentWeb,"This is something I have been thinking about recently. Basically the idea how the Web is going to evolve in the future with AI. You can read the whole thing at my post, but just to flag a few things here:

""The web is splitting into two distinct futures: one driven by relentless AI agents, the other shaped by human hands. It fills me with both excitement and sadness - excited by the possibilities of AI-driven efficiency, yet nostalgic for the craftsmanship of a human touch. Let's dive into what this means for the future of web development and ownership.

# The Rise of AgentWeb

The AgentWeb represents the industrialisation of web development, where AI agents autonomously build, maintain, and optimise websites at scale. These digital properties will be born in vast WebFarms (remember Bitcoin farms?) where AI systems handle everything from design decisions to content optimisation and user experience refinement.

For website owners, this means hands-off management with AI handling:

* Complete brand identity creation and evolution
* Content creation and SEO optimisation
* Automated maintenance and security updates
* Real-time performance monitoring and optimisation
* User experience refinement through continuous testing
* Integrated social media presence and content distribution

# The Future Renaissance of ArtisanWeb

On the flip side, we might be witnessing a renaissance of handcrafted websites. Like craft beer versus mass-produced lagers, ArtisanWeb represents the boutique approach to web development. I can imagine content on the web being labeled¬†Handcrafted by a Human¬†or¬†No AI Was Used in Creating This Content.

The interesting thing is that while handcrafted web will be proud to display these labels, web farms would not do the opposite:¬†AI Generated Content. They are likely to try to fake that they are really hand-made content. In the same way¬†[browsers once faked their identities to gain compatibility](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/?ref=mantcz.com), AI-generated websites might strive to mimic human craftsmanship to gain trust‚Äîa new battle for authenticity in the AI driven digital age.""

I am curious to hear what people think.

webdev,Next steps for semi-successful websites (and devs),"I have made a few websites over the years, but have substantially stepped up my skills over the last 12 months or so through uni study.

I currently have a simple game website averaging about 400 users per day and 10,000 views per week. It‚Äôs a little puzzle game that resets every 24 hours.

After a couple months of very little interaction it has built up to this point completely organically over a few months, but the growth is slowing.

So what do now? Try and advertise the site? Put google ads on the site and hopefully get $20-30 per week hoping not to alienate the users?

My full time work is currently in audio production and journalism so I am used to building creative things with technology. I think I could make more websites that attract users, but who knows? Making a living wage out of this feels pretty improbable. 

The most complicated website I have made but not put on the internet is a e-commerce site with flask - besides that mostly little games. I consider myself a bit more of a creative than strictly a dev - I can do a lot with a little. Having said that I am studying comp sci post-grad.

Apologies for the rambling - just looking for some help or direction. There might be an answer staring me in the face or a job that I‚Äôm not aware of?

webdev,software developer doesn't know where to start to fix existing wordpress page,"Hello, for context I am frontend developer and have never done anything with wordpress and it's a shame to admit, but I have never hosted any webpage (or maybe I did when I was studying, but can't remember).

My friend told me that his wordpress webpage has issues and is showing some sort of errors when he tries to edit in cms (content management system) and asked me to fix those issues without ruining page SEO (so that google doesn't show it lower in results) and without losing any content that was added through cms, because my friend had previous experience when developer deleted all content that was added before.

I'm not sure where to start... Right now I just asked him for credentials to access cms.

Where should I start? What information do I need from my client (friend)? Is it possible and should I make some sort of backup of the page? Bonus question - can I adjust styling of that page and do some layout changes without ruining content added through cms or messing up current google result position?

But apparently, I have to create a Facebook app?  And get approval for that app?  Seems like a lot of obstacles to go through just to perform a simple task.

My intention is not to distribute this app or for other users to use.  I simply want to be able to post to pages I administrate without having to log into Facebook each time.

Other APIs I have used usually involve having an ID and a Secret to generate a token - which is then presented within a POST to the API's URL with fields for what content you want to post or do.

webdev,How to communicate better during meetings? ,"I‚Äôm a new developer and an issue I‚Äôm facing is being able to clearly communicate the challenges of a task during team meetings. Sometimes clients would make requests to add something new or modify something prebuilt that sounds easy to do in theory but poses a great technical challenge. It could either be something entirely impossible to do or beyond my skillset. I‚Äôve found when I try to communicate the difficulties, I‚Äôm being seen as ‚Äúnot having a can do attitude‚Äù or ‚Äúnot wanting to do the hard work‚Äù. Boss would interrupt me and tell me I just have to figure something out. 

I feel that my job as a developer is to clearly communicate the possibilities of what the client is asking for and/or provide possible solutions. But my boss just wants me to pretty much say yes to whatever and I think it‚Äôs because the more time I spend on the project the more he can charge the client. This may mean going away with a task then doing absolutely nothing and saying I‚Äôve tried xyz and it didn‚Äôt work whereas this whole bullshit could‚Äôve been avoided in the first place. I‚Äôm getting paid so not exactly complaining but this feels exploitative. 

And the other developers although understand the scope of the task, they just agree with the boss and the client to stay on their good side because it‚Äôs gonna be me doing the work anyways and not them. Also during calls they would briefly look at my code and confirm with the client exactly what I‚Äôve said which I find disrespectful because I‚Äôm the one who wrote the code yet the client is more trusting towards someone who‚Äôs not even part of the project. They‚Äôre also very quick to make suggestions even though they don‚Äôt know anything about the codebase which is annoying asf.

webdev,Was interviewer being picky?,"I completed a relatively simple task for a Frontend Developer position. One part involved making a single word in a block of HTML bold.

I understand their perspective, but aren‚Äôt both approaches valid? My reasoning was that if design requirements changed in a real-world scenario (e.g., the bold word needed a different color or style later), it would be easier to manage through CSS without touching the HTML structure.

webdev,"How do server-sent event ""streams"" work on a lower level?","Hi, and sorry for the lack of a tl;dr; - I'm not sure how to get away from providing the context. Basically I'm interested in connecting to a web server and consuming [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) using a lower level HTTP API and am hoping somebody can explain how the push vs pull of these events might work at a lower level.

I'm working on a hardware project (ESP32-S3 / espressif ESP-IDF based) where I'm writing C with a bit of higher level abstraction to support HTTP interactions. For example, the methods I might call are:

* `esp_http_client_open()`: Open the HTTP connection with write_len parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set write_len=0 for read-only connection.
* `esp_http_client_fetch_headers()`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). 
* `esp_http_client_read()`: Read the HTTP stream
* `esp_http_client_close()`: Close the connection.

([more examples / docs are here if you're currious](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client.html#http-stream))

Now what I'm trying to figure out is what `esp_http_client_read()` actually is doing in terms of the server to client communication. When I connect to a server over HTTP, and assuming `keep-alive`, I can call `esp_http_client_read()` every millisecond, or I can wait 100 milliseconds and call it. Both ""work"" in that if there is no data being sent from the server, nothing will happen, and if there is data, I'll read it and be able to do something with it. _edit: for clarity because it may be non-obvious, my intention is to have my hardware device connect to a server and stay connected to it indefinitely, waiting for the server to send data using server-sent events - so picture a while(true) loop, but I'm responsible myself for checking when new data comes in_

But I don't have a good sense of what it means to ""read data"" in an already open HTTP stream. As far as I'm aware, for this type of connection (which is similar as far as I understand to a chunked response), nothing is communicated to the server asking for more data for example, it's certainly not like an additional HTTP request is being made. I'm guessing ""read data"" just checks some sort of lower level buffer handled by the WiFi chip or some lower subsystem. I'm guessing if I chose to ""read data"" from an HTTP connection the server is none the wiser. 

That said, I also might 100% wrong, and perhaps (like other forms of communication) part of the underlying protocol is a message to the server that you've read data. This might not be important to the server, but perhaps it acts as a sort of heartbeat. 

My end goal here is to understand how often I should call ""read data"" in my code optimizing for quickly getting updates from the server but also not having any negative impact on the server or taking up needless CPU cycles by reading data every millisecond when once every 50ms would suffice for my needs. 

I'm hoping somebody in the web dev community who perhaps has more experience or a better understanding of lower level HTTP ""stuff"" might be able to understand the spirit of what I'm asking and help me understand.

# Setup:

1. **Auth Provider**: Supabase handles user authentication (sign-up, login, etc.).
2. **Local Database**: I save additional user data in my local PostgreSQL database for more advanced app features.
3. **NestJS Backend**: Acts as the bridge between Supabase and my local database, ensuring synchronization.

# Use Case:

Whenever a user signs up, updates their profile, or deletes their account, I need to:

1. **Create/Update/Delete the user in Supabase** (for authentication).
2. **Create/Update/Delete the user in my local database** (for app-specific data).
3. Ensure that both systems remain synchronized (handle errors, retries, rollbacks, etc.).

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you worked on a similar use case? What‚Äôs the best way to ensure synchronization between two systems like Supabase and a local database?

webdev,NodeJS work on WordPress?,"You'll have to pardon the ignorance guys, but I'm wondering what the best way to interface nodeJS with WordPress is? I have a shared server on Hostinger. No nodeJS functionality. I don't care to configure a VPS.

I wish to write a WooCommerce extension / plugin with a client-side image manipulation feature for my WordPress site eg. dynamic text, crop &amp; resize images. JIMP for node seems like an optimal solution.

Ideally, the user would be able to manipulate the text on the actual image. Not in an external text input. My intention is to create a WooCommerce extension for my site. Have the user manipulate an image. Upload to my server. Pay over WooCommerce. I'll use a pdf api to create a pdf. Print this and post it to them. 

Something like the Photo Editor SDK:

webdev,Standard SSL to AutoSSL in cPanel?,"  
i decided to go with godaddy for webhosting (already regretting this after scrolling through this sub) and i got standard SSL and my website wont work (im getting the connection is not private message). I chatgpt'd it and its saying i need **AutoSSL**. I recently purchased a **Standard SSL certificate** from GoDaddy,  and i called the help desk and they told me to switch to **AutoSSL** because it automatically handles SSL installations and renewals, and I‚Äôd rather not manage SSL certificates manually.... 

Here's what I've done so far:

1. **Purchased a Standard SSL** from GoDaddy.
2. Installed the certificate manually via **cPanel**.
3. I saw that my certificate is self-signed in cPanel.

# What I want to do:

  
Make my website work.

I want **AutoSSL** to take over and automatically install and renew my SSL certificates. I‚Äôve checked my cPanel, but I **don‚Äôt see an option for AutoSSL** anywhere in the **SSL/TLS Manager** or **SSL/TLS Status** sections. I also don‚Äôt see an option to **enable AutoSSL** in cPanel.

# Questions:

1. **Am I missing something?** Should AutoSSL be available by default, or is it something that needs to be enabled by GoDaddy?
2. **How do I get AutoSSL working for my domain?** Do I need to enable it manually, or does GoDaddy handle that?
3. **Is AutoSSL only available on specific hosting plans?** I'm on a basic hosting plan, so I‚Äôm wondering if AutoSSL is available for my plan.

If anyone has had similar issues with GoDaddy and cPanel, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on how to get AutoSSL up and running.

Thank you so much for the help. ",computer21,1h6324w,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6324w/standard_ssl_to_autossl_in_cpanel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h6324w/standard_ssl_to_autossl_in_cpanel/,2024-12-04 00:35:05,6,1.0,6,0,1,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h6324w
webdev,Genuinely do you need a JS framework?,"Genuinely do you need a JS framework?

I was just talking with some coworkers, and one of them brought up that they think the bell curve meme around the use of JS frameworks would be low IQ - use framework, mid IQ - just use base HTML CSS JS, high IQ - you must use a JS framework.

Personally I am of the opinion that JS frameworks have their place but for the vast majority of websites you don't need anything other than a templating language and vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

I've certainly written webapps that required the use a JS framework, but I would hardly call those websites they were more extremely complicated web apps that simply could not have been made without the use of a framework.

But that's the exception and 99% of all websites on the internet don't need anything more than HTML + a templating language for format, CSS for layout and prettiness, and JavaScript for interactivity (frankly HTML and CSS get you 90% of your interactivity), server requests, and content reactivity. There's a reason 80% of the internet is PHP, and why libraries like HTMX, and frameworks like Astro are becoming so popular - because they just get out of your way.

I sort of responded that for work and for personal projects I mainly build websites using no framework, and I asked why does he think that's the shape of the bell curve. But he didn't seem open to having a dialogue about it, and just kept responding ""it's just what it is"" with a really smug smile. And I didn't want to push it further / potentially start any conflict with a coworker so I dropped it.

I just feel like frameworks add so much complexity and overhead to development (unless your app truly absolutely needs it), that it's really unnecessary and creates so much work compared to using no framework and at the end of the day your user won't notice a difference. 

Runtimes, CSS modules, picking/learning a package, package specific JS, npm packages, typescript, webpack, docker, build tools, hosting... Homie this is a static page that fetches content on load and sends basic CRUD requests to the server, I could have it finished and hosted before you have your environment set up and project initiated. And mine will be functional with JS disabled and for users with 3G connections.

But I'm really curious, is the use a framework (JS or other) really the big brain move, and every website no matter what should use one.

webdev,Burnout / Career transition,"Hi everyone, 

recently I have been feeling pretty shit. I work at a big office corporation as a software engineer. Work is not that exciting. I am definitelly burning out and starting to hate sitting in front of a monitor in order to pay rent. 

So I've been trying to manage this feeling by doing something tactile after work, like knitting and fixing stuff around the house. One evening it dawned on me that I could get like another 'fallback' skill just in case I decide to ditch my developer career. 

I am looking for suggestions on what I could currently handle in my situation and what I could develop as a skill that could maybe one day be my fulltime gig. For contex - I'm male, living in eastern europe, mid twenties.   
  
The limitations are:

* it must be something I could get good at just by learning/practicing at home; 
* preferably not involving staring at a screen;
* is paid fairly well; 
* will not be redundant in 5-10 years; 
* doesn't cost a lot of financial investment immediately; 

So far I've considered, tufting custom rugs, working with silver jewelry, woodworking handyman (shelves, cutting boards ect), bathroom tiling, nail technitian, massagist and aromatherapy.  
  
If you've got any suggestions or ideas I would be very very greatful! Looking for new skills and opportunities!

webdev,Am I an asshole for blocking my friend over a hobby web app project?,"TL;DR: my friend expects me to work hard on his hobby project, berated me for not complete the task he assigned so I was mad and block him.

My friend is a senior dev (mainly focus on data engineering) who has worked for multiple large projects, for the last few months started a side project with his friend and invited me to join them. The project is a platform which helps connect designers and let them share their artworks and stuff.

Having bad experiences working with multiple projects like this, where I spent LOTS of time to build apps for friends' ideas (which they promised will be very interesting and lucrative lol) but then received almost nothing in return; I hesitated at first but he said it's just a hobby project to hone our skills so just chilling around. No money involved and just focus on dev so no big issues it seems, I accepted his invitation.

On boarding last weekend, was told about purposes of the project and team, but I didn't receive any overview of the app nor any doc as it hasnt been written yet. I was assigned a small task to begin with. Well it's cool, gotta dive in the code then, it's what I usually do anyway. Though I'm a self taught dev for 6+ years on and off, the project is mainly front-end in Nextjs using supabase for auth which I only have experience in less than 1 year, so took me sometimes to be familiar.

HERE COMES THE PROBLEM. The app was built okay on my machine but whenever I changed a bit of the code, my WSL crashed entirely and took 2 3 minutes to restart. The codebase seems okay, but it's quite large so I reported to him it will take me sometimes to debug and to make it work properly. He was mildly frustrated and kept checking me every 3 4 hours if I have finished the task assigned yet as he and others don't have the problem as I do. It was on weekend so I was quite annoyed to be forced to work by him, as I have other stuffs to do with my family.

Fast forward to monday, after spent 10+ hours debugging, going over the web app to test as well as the codebase and other tasks/ issues have done in the last few months, I noted down some points which can improve the app. I also noted that it's only my suggestions, not necessary to change anything now; and I will work on the task assigned today as I have fixed the crashing error.

He called me over and was ULTRA mad and tell me:

- I was too distracted and unprofessional. I MUST and CAN code the task because it's so easy according to him, no need the app to run to do it.

- My coding skill is subpar as the 2 unpaid interns who havent graduated yet can do it easily. He even stressed that the university they come from is below-average.

- Scolded me because I'm distracted so they may miss their deadline

- My coding skill is ass so in the future he can't give me big task, and he MUST break it down to small ones for me to complete it

- He said in a assumed circumstance, if one of his employees acts unprofessional like I did what will he feel about them (disappointed, angry etc.)

- He told me to finished the task immediately, and he will check in after 0.5 hour. Or else he will be so mad.

- Said that this project is good but no promise for economic value in the future; though I can add it to my portfolio for better recognition for future employer lol.

- Said that he commited 4 5 hours per day for this project so he expects me to do the same

After that I was so mad as I feel I do nothing wrong?; so after complete the task and a few hours I blocked him all around. One of my close friend told me I was too rushed and need to explain to him explicitly (which I did previously). So am I an asshole to block him too quickly like that?",kenvinams,1h4xct4,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4xct4/am_i_an_asshole_for_blocking_my_friend_over_a/,2024-12-02 15:21:32,134,0.82,134,0,184,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h4xct4

webdev,Can't get everything recolored correctly for custom css.,"\[SOLVED\]

I am trying to learn css by creating a general custom css that works for all website in the nord theme. I took the solarized-everything project and tried to add a generic nord theme for all site.

In some websites, e.g. reddit, this bit from the pictures for replies don't seem to get recolored.

Other things in reddit that doesn't get recolored is the markdown editor box for post. Home popular, explore tabs when they are highlighted etc. Others relatively blend in but the subsequent thread line for replies and hide replies area are very jarring to see.

How do I fix this?

\[SOLUTION\]

It was taking a global variable `--color-neutral-background`

However setting the variable in `:root` didn't work but setting it to `*` worked

\[[Here](https://github.com/jojowakaki/dots/blob/main/config/qutebrowser/solarized-everything-css/css/nord-dark-all-sites.css)\] is the css just in case somone is interested.

webdev,Monorepo architecture and scopes,"Monorepo architecture

Hi there! I‚Äôm using NX with Angular for a monorepo (but I don‚Äôt think this issue is specific to Angular nor NX) (4 projects, multiple libraries). As the repo is growing, the current library structure feels unsustainable, and responsibilities between modules are becoming unclear. Here's the current setup:

# Current Library Structure

1. `libs/features`
   * Each ""screen"" (micro-frontend) gets its own library.
   * **Problem:** Shared logic across screens creates overlapping responsibilities.
2. `libs/services`
   * Libraries aligned with backend microservices, split into subcategories:
      * **UI:** Frontend-specific logic/components for an ""entity"" such as order-card.
      * **Feature:** Core functionality (but sometimes imports across services, which feels wrong). Could be a smart search screen for orders, an oder dialog etc.
      * **Data-access:** Backend-specific data handling logic. Like order-rest/websockets
   * **Problem:** The ""feature"" sub-lib crosses boundaries and doesn‚Äôt align with service isolation. And it doesnt seem to make sense since its generally more defined by the wanted frontend functionality.
3. `libs/shared`
   * Shared functionality, including:
      * Config
      * Notifications handling
      * Shared UI components not tied to entities

# Questions

1. **UI Libraries**
   * Should all UI components be consolidated under `libs/shared/ui` and divided into sub-libraries/categories (e.g., `shared/ui/&lt;category&gt;`)?
2. **Backend vs. Frontend Domains**
   * Should backend-related libraries only include `data-access` and avoid mixing in UI or feature logic?
   * Should the frontend code be reorganized into ""frontend domains,"" where each domain encapsulates:
      * Shared business logic
      * Specific screens (which could eventually become micro-frontends)?

# Goals

* **Clear separation of concerns**
* **Sustainable structure as the repo grows**
* **Logical boundaries between backend services and frontend domains**

# How should I reorganize my libraries to achieve this?

  
Really grateful for any inputs or direction. Im feeling a bit lost at how to best structure this. I think the way to go is splitting things up more by front-end domains. But what sort of library types would be suitable, and which scopes and types should be limited from importing what?

webdev,Is This Login/Signup System Secure and Efficient? Looking for Feedback,"Hi, I‚Äôve built a login/signup system for my website and would love your feedback. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sign-Up Flow**

* User fills out name, email, password (validated for strength) and completes hCaptcha.
* Frontend sends a POST request to /api/auth/register with user data and hCaptcha token.
* Server validates data, verifies hCaptcha, and creates a ""pending user"" with:
   * Hashed password, 6-digit OTP (valid 5 mins), and expiration (30 mins).
* OTP is emailed to the user for verification.
* On valid OTP, a user account is created, and the pending entry is removed.

**2. Sign-In Flow**

* User enters email/password.
* Server verifies credentials and creates a session via NextAuth.
* On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

**3. Additional Security**

* Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
* Failed logins tracked for account lockout.
* Background task clears expired pending users every 5 minutes.
* Password resets use the same OTP process as registration.

**4. Session Management**

* Handled by NextAuth with token storage in cookies.

**Questions:**

* Is this secure enough?
* Any improvements to the email verification or overall flow?
* Other tips for a better user experience or security?

However I have no experience with React, Tailwind, Vercel or Supabase (just vanilla CSS + JS, HTML/EJS, PostrgreSQL, hosting on Railway)

So really I want some help understanding:

1. Over the next 3 months, am I likely to have saved more time by learning React + Tailwind + Supabase or is it better to stick with my vanilla stack if I'm aiming to maximise progress in 3 months?
2. If I were to create my MVP using my current ""vanilla"" stack and hire a software dev in 3 months, would there likely be lots of technical debt to overcome or would converting to the new stack be relatively easy?

React seems to be the really big one to learn, so I'm also considering just learning tailwind + supabase, and leaving React for later.

webdev,Can anyone explain how scrollbars  determine which element they get attached to? Mine is getting attached to the body for whatever reason and don't really understand it...,"I have encountered the worst problem in my web dev project. **SCROLLBARS**

Imagine implementing a *simple* chat system and you know nothing about websockets and broadcasting yet the **worst roadblock** is getting the scrollbar to go down in a react app.. I can get it to go down when I set `h-[some value]` but it won't go down otherwise...

So I throw in some `overflow` magic. Nah uh, the scrollbar ain't moving an inch.. I do all my scrollbar effecting witchcraft (looking at you **tailwind**) on the element that I think is managing the scrollbar. It did not move one inch. Then I change the potions, seems like `useEffect` ain't cutting it, so my truth sayer (**chat gpt**) recommended `useLayoutEffect`  and it still did not work. Then I go on a hunt for the element which the scroll bar is getting attached to.

Turns out it is getting attached to the body element. I was able to confirm this by adding overflow-hidden to the parent components one by one and it only worked on the body element!!

Now the realization hit me, I know nothing of scrollbars. I can't seem to find a resource to actually learn what it is relevant to my current **context**. I have spent hours on this problem and can't seem to figure it out.

EDIT: Did not add code because idk if it is allowed here

EDIT: Further context: In a chat app, the scrollbar should be at the bottom coz you want to see the latest message not the oldest.

webdev,News Article Content without JavaScript,"Curiosity question. I noticed this with Bloomberg but I've seen it with several others: the article content is unloaded if JavaScript is disabled, and not to be found in the HTML or DOM.

A lot of news websites (paywalled or otherwise) still load the article content, sometimes hidden, in the HTML with JavaScript disabled. I've noticed lots don't. 

Is this because Google has gotten better at loading the articles when it crawls so gating it behind a paywall doesn't matter anymore for SEO? Maybe there is some access token or element the crawler uses or they give search engines the article content from somewhere else (or don't care that much about losing out on search results if it gets them paid subs)?",KDLGates,1h5as5e,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5as5e/news_article_content_without_javascript/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h5as5e/news_article_content_without_javascript/,2024-12-03 00:42:16,5,0.99,5,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h5as5e

webdev,Managing High-Volume Notifications with Digest (Batching) Strategies,"I'm implementing a notification system using [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) that needs to handle high message volumes without overwhelming users. 

I'd like to share my current approach and get feedback on potential improvements.

**Context:**

* Building a collaborative app with frequent updates (comments, file changes, tags)
* Using Novu as the notification infrastructure
* Need to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring important updates reach users
* Currently implementing in Node.js with PostgreSQL backend

**Current Implementation:** I've developed two digest strategies in Novu:

1. **Time-Window Digest / Batching:** 

&amp;#8203;

     // Using Novu to collect events in a 3-day digest window  
    const digestResult = await novu.digest(""digest-3-days"", {
      backoffUnit: 'days',
      backoffAmount: 3,
      digestKey: 'userId',
      events: notifications
    });  
    
    // Send digest via Novu
    await novu.trigger('digest-notification', {
      to: {
        subscriberId: userId,
      },
      payload: {
        events: digestResult.events,
        totalCount: digestResult.events.length
      }
    });

2. **Look-Back Pattern:**

    const shouldDigest = async (userId, eventType) =&gt; {
      const recentNotification = await novu.getNotificationHistory({
        subscriberId: userId,
        type: eventType
      });
      return Date.now() - recentNotification.timestamp &lt; ONE_DAY;
    };

Here is a visual representation I'm referring to - but with much smaller batching time window:

[Digest \/ Event Aggregation ](https://preview.redd.it/qozoe9akbf4e1.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301cfb85c68526175d084b86374fa8f3c29a3c21)

**Interesting Discovery -** [OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/journeys#time-window)**'s Time Window Approach:** While researching this, I found OneSignal's implementation of time windows interesting.   
  
They use a different approach where you can:

* Define specific allowed time periods (e.g., Tuesday 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST)
* Set intelligent delivery delays that randomly distribute notifications within allowed windows
* Handle out-of-window notifications by scheduling them for the next available window

For example, if you set a notification to trigger outside of Tuesday 1-6 PM PST, their system automatically schedules it for a random time within next Tuesday's window. This helps prevent notification clustering at window boundaries.

**Technical Challenges I'm Working Through:**

1. Race conditions when multiple events occur simultaneously
2. Handling failed notification deliveries within digest groups
3. Database schema optimization for efficient event aggregation
4. Coordinating time windows across multiple time zones
5. Implementing similar time-window functionality as OneSignal within Novu

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. What indexing strategies work best for quick digest compilation in Novu?
2. How do you handle digest delivery failures and retries?
3. Has anyone implemented custom time window logic similar to OneSignal's approach in Novu?
4. What's your approach to testing digest timing across different time zones?

If you've implemented similar systems with Novu or other notification services, I'd appreciate insights on handling these technical aspects efficiently.",Sudden_Profit_2840,1h4t9jv,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h4t9jv/managing_highvolume_notifications_with_digest/,2024-12-02 11:53:39,39,0.98,39,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/S_ZmR_1cU5aKbwzfea80L7OQ7oKBdb43DuJDAxM8-xM.jpg,t3_1h4t9jv

webdev,Best WYSIWYG website editor with full website control? (Leaving Squarespace),"I‚Äôm migrating my photography website away from Squarespace because it‚Äôs too limiting. I can‚Äôt manage my web pages and other media files directly (no FTP or local mounting), making it impossible for me to automate webpage creation amongst other things. 

This makes managing the many photo galleries I have, and something as simple as linking full-res images to every photo a huge pain. The latter is not even possible on Squarespace‚Äîwhen you upload a 12 MP photo to a gallery, it gets downsampled to 1-2 MP and there's no way to view the original-resolution file. Nor can I link the original resolution file to that gallery preview. 

I need a platform where I can control the entire website structure (individual HTML pages and media), ideally with local file system access via FTP or similar. My goal is to use Python scripts to automate tasks like generating new galleries/web pages, uploading images, and linking previews inside a gallery to full-resolution files (Squarespace forcibly downsamples images and the full-res versions are inaccessible to the end user).

What platforms would you recommend for this level of customization? Note that I do prefer a WYSIWYG editor so that I'm not spending hours setting stuff up from scratch, but when I need to do more powerful things like change sections across all my photo galleries, I want the option for stuff like multi-file regex replacements across all my galleries' HTML files.

webdev,Recommended Architecture for Small Business Site,"I‚Äôve been tasked with making a site with a reservation system for my family‚Äôs business. All the costumers are within the state and reservations will only occur 2 months of the year. 

Although a serverless architecture could be less expensive (probably free) I‚Äôm thinking of just getting a cheap vps instead. Idk tho. I was initially thinking about using next.js but the site needs very little reactivity. It‚Äôs basically just a form so using a frontend framework seems excessive. I could probably get away with using web components. 

I need a form with up-to-date info for making reservations and a basic CRUD admin dashboard (and therefore auth)

What are your thoughts on what technology and frameworks i should use? With so many products nowadays it seems impossible to decide. 

My current thoughts are:
Express + EJS + Web Components (when reactivity is needed) on a VPS and possibly SQLite on the VPS

webdev,"I can not gain traction, short shory","Hi, 

I just wanted to share my not-short but not-long journey. I have been doing freelancing on the side as a full-time developer for some time. I noticed that the competition is too high to get jobs on Upwork and make money. So, I slowly transitioned to indie hacker, solopreneur, entrepreneur, CEO, founder, or whatever you would like to call it because I wanted to scale. With the speed of AI, it is very easy to do small projects; with Vercel, it is very easy to deploy them. But that is it.

Building does not mean anything. If I were to build a website/app that does quantum calculations. It will remain as a hidden gem. It will be useless. Marketing is hard. It is much harder than software development. If I don‚Äôt stay active on social media and don‚Äôt comment on everything literally, everything. All the graphs goes to zero immediately. 

Like, I am not saying I built the quantum computer. That‚Äôs also the other thing. I am making these stupid projects. So that at some point  I would get the inspiration for the big thing, but that is also not happening. I don‚Äôt want to quit yet. But this is not just about just shipping it. It consumes more than a full-time job. It needs dedication, unfortunately, and most importantly, it needs luck. 

A thread of luck, an algorithm picking it up, and you are done for. You don‚Äôt need to try anymore, and I am very sorry about it. Because luck never strikes me.

webdev,I've created a sports competitions draw simulator,"Hey guys!

I'd like to introduce you to **DICEDRAW**, a web project that I've been developing with great pleasure recently. It's a website dedicated to **simulating draws for sports competitions**, currently focused on soccer. It already has draws for the Champions League, Europa League and, more recently, the new Club World Cup. The latter deserves a special mention because we're only a few days away from the official draw, and we can see how things might end up lining up.

The idea is that each draw respects the specific rules of each competition. In other words, nothing will be seen that goes against the rules of the entities. I've also included the new league stages of UEFA competitions, such as the Champions League, which has replaced the group stage.

If you have any suggestions or even ideas for other competitions you'd like to see there, let me know! I'm also accepting contributions to the project's repository, in case you want to get your hands on the code. And if you find it useful, leave a star there, it always gives you a boost of motivation.

I intend to continue evolving the project, and it would be great to have your feedback to make it even better!

I invite you to try it out below:

I remember the saying ""if something is free, you're the product"". I'm wondering if that's the case here.

Same goes for Microsoft copilot as well, and that one can generate unlimited images while chatgpt has a limit on free tier. And it's much better at image generation from what I've experienced so far. Response -wise, free tier chatgpt can still kick copilots ass though.

webdev,How would Google selling Chrome stop its monopoly?,"Might be off-topic to this sub, but I don't know what other sub would have redditors with enough knowledge about the web to answer this correctly.

My understanding is that Google has tried to maintain a monopoly over the search engine market by making other companies use Google as the main search engine for their browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).

If that's the case, what's the point of having Google sell Chrome, the browser? There are plenty of other browsers out there -- Google doesn't hold a monopoly over the browser market. Chromium is a thing, yes, but neither Firefox nor Safari is Chromium based, and Chromium is open source anyway. The problem here is the ubiquity of 'Google' the search engine, not Chrome the browser.

TLDR: if what Google holds a monopoly over is the search engine that browsers use and not over browsers themselves, how does selling Chrome stop their monopoly?",cachehit_,1h491sj,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h491sj/how_would_google_selling_chrome_stop_its_monopoly/,2024-12-01 17:55:57,80,0.83,80,0,92,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h491sj

So I thought myself front end development‚Ä¶


I‚Äôve had this idea for a job board for forever.  But everyone was way too expensive to hire. So I started teaching myself coding at the middle of last year.   The journey had been up and down, but now I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm comfortable with front end development.  The problem is, now I need to learn the back end, and I am very burnt out after spending all my nights and some weekends to get to where I‚Äôm at now.  So I‚Äôve been looking at different options, here they are:

1. Pay $10,000 for someone to start my project and hopefully have a mvp by the end of it.  I have a better job now, so I can save the money in probably a few months
2. Continue to learn, whether it be self learning or taking a class.  Self learning is cool, but I have no one to ask questions to.  And taking a class would take far too long.  

Those both are a little far away for my liking.  So, I thought of a new idea today!  I thought about just hiring a backend developer.  I could build the front, which would save me lots of money, and someone could do the backend.  The only issue is, I have no idea on how to hire a backend developer.  Do I hire a company?  Do I try and get a freelancer?  If so from where?  I‚Äôve looked at fivver and that option doesn‚Äôt work for me because I need someone I can have a conversation with and I don‚Äôt understand accents very well in learning environments.

Sometimes it takes about a minute to load, sometimes it gives an error page. I am using Namecheap domains, and this is what the redirect widget looks like:

[for some reason, I can't use \\""https:\/\/www.bongable.cc\\""](https://preview.redd.it/bsnthk5uxe4e1.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd0b9f2e200d60e9198b7cf2743a988710a369be)

The reason for the last one is a recurring problem where different browsers will add the ""https://"" automatically.

Is there an easy way to link an easy URL like ""bongable.cc"" to the Github.io address so that it loads faster and has less errors?

Also, I'm testing out the website on different browsers in their respective ""Private"" modes to avoid loading from the cache. Is this method of testing flawed? I might be tripping a little, but I foresee some customers quitting if the site doesn't load quick enough :/

Do I have to buy actual webhosting to get this to load correctly? All I'm really trying for right now is a simple site with a discord link and links to some documents that are also on Github.io.

webdev,Optimal Oauth flow?,"My web app has react frontend and java backend.
Will be using keycloak on the backend eventually.

Here's how the oauth flow would go: 
1. On the frontend user clicks authenticate which calls an auth endpoint on backend.

2. On the backend, a random state param is generated and what not. 
Then auth url is formed (with query params: state, clientId etc, and sent to auth provider for authentication code.
Redirection url is set as a backend endpoint.
The backend sends/redirects this url to the front end.

3. On the frontend the resource owner would be on the auth provider's auth page to either allow or decline the requested scopes.

4. Assuming the resource owner accepts, the auth code would be sent as query params with the backend redirect url. 

5. The backend endpoint verifies state param, auth code and obtains an auth token. Stores the auth token in db.

At this point, what does the frontend do to check if step 5 has been successfully executed since at step 4, the redirect url calls the backend endpoint and not the frontend endpoint.

webdev,Authentication with jwt,"Im learning about authentication with jwt on a nest backend and next front end.

Im a bit confused though and looking for guidance:

Example will be user logging in

1). User inputs credentials and submits post req to backend
2). Backend communicates with DB to validate credentials and generate/sign a jwt token containing user_id
3). Backend sends token to frontend via response 
4). Front end stores token in cookies for authenticating with backend for future requests / private route access
5).  Front end decodes jwt for user ID at what point and why???

I've also read you shouldn't pass username and info through jwt because it's a security risk, but I also read so is passing it through the response object.... So how exactly does one securely move user data from DB to frontend without exposing it unnecessarily???

I'm using Docker Compose + Dozzle for such purposes to run batch of services and watch logs, but with this approach the file system can slow down a lot when live reload is enabled.

Recently I found out that there are Procfile and overmind, which allow to conveniently run several services at once with one command without virtualization. But logs are shown in a single console and it is not convenient to see what is going on (my application has a large business logic and a lot of communication back and forth, so a lot of logs).

UPD:

Combining [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) (Procfile launcher) and [logdy](https://logdy.dev/) (logs viewer from pipe to browser) can be working

webdev,How I solved common Prisma ORM errors,"I have been using Prisma ORM for the last 2 years, and I have experience with troubleshooting different types of error.

In this post, I want to share it with you, so you don‚Äôt have to spend hours figuring out what I‚Äôve already learned.

**Why Prisma?**

I have been using Prisma to interact with the database for all my SaaS products. So far, I‚Äôve built six SaaS products, and I hope to build more in the future (some of them are [BlackTwist](https://blacktwist.app), [Wuf](https://usewuf.com), [Userdesk](https://userdesk.io), [Inboxs](https://inboxs.io), [Hivoe](https://hivoe.com)).

I've used Prisma in Next.js web apps, node.js servers, and cron jobs.

The key goals of using Prisma are:

* keep under control your database schema
   * define tables and types
   * apply migrations
   * query your database with type safety
   * avoid typing errors
* protect from SQL injection
* leverage pooling

**Common issues**

Despite being a stable product, sometimes you can encounter some issues.

Below I describe two common errors:

* migration errors
* query errors

Let‚Äôs start with the first one.

**Error with data migrations**

Sometimes your migrations emit an error, that‚Äôs not very simple to debug, like this one.

    Error: ERROR: prepared statement ""s2"" does not exist

You usually get this error when you run `npx prisma db push` (apply your schema changes to the database) or `npx prisma generate` (generate the types from your schema).

But what does this mean?

This error happens when using a relational database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (one of the most popular, and advanced open-source SQL databases on the market).

Specifically, a prepared statement in PostgreSQL is a feature that allows you to execute a query plan that is prepared and stored by the database server for reuse. It improves performance and security, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values.

Prisma ORM leverages the prepared statements as part of its database query execution process, under the hood (but you don‚Äôt have to know or master prepared statements to use Prisma).

The main issues arise with the confusion between the different database connections string configurations, pooling and PgBouncer.

Let me go straight to the solution, then I explain you the different parts.

The main solution I‚Äôve found is to use two connection strings, one to run the migrations and the second for the execution of your web application / node.js server.

First, identify the correct connection strings for your database.

The connection string to run the migrations is the direct access to the database (no pooling or PgBouncer), like for instance

    postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname

Save this connection string as an environment variable called `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`.

    DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=""postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

Secondly, get the connection string with the pool, for instance:

    postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName

Get this connection string from your database hosting provider, the parameters might be different.

Save this connection string as an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL`.

    DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://user:password@host:post/poolName""

Add it to your local `.env` file and to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, Render, and so on).

The second step is to update the Prisma configuration to use these two environment variables.

Open the file `schema.prisma` and update the section `datasource db` to include this:

    datasource db {
      provider  = ""postgresql""
      url       = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
      directUrl = env(""DATABASE_DIRECT_URL"")
    }

Now, run the usual commands like `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma generate` locally to ensure that everything is working correctly, and run your application locally.

If all is good, push the modifications to your hosting service and trigger a new deployment for the modifications to take effect.

Prisma is now correctly configured and you should not have the same issue again.

**Query performance issues**

Recently, I got the ""stack depth limit exceeded"" error message.

    PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Invalid `prisma.table.findMany()` invocation: Error occurred during query execution: ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: ""54001"", message: ""stack depth limit exceeded"", severity: ""ERROR"", detail: None, column: None, hint: Some(""Increase the configuration parameter \""max_stack_depth\"" (currently 2048kB), after ensuring the platform's stack depth limit is adequate."") }), transient: false })

This means that the usage of memory exceeds the database configuration for a specific query.

I ran this SQL command on my database and found this value:

    SHOW max_stack_depth;
    ---
    2MB

I had a query that was returning 1900+ records to aggregate some values.

For each record I have to recalculate the sum of certain values.

When this happens you have two options:

* increase the `max_stack_depth` value in your database
* refactor the logic in the code to avoid to run that big query
* optimize the query

I tried to increase `max_stack_depth` because it was the quickest solution (not the best one), but my database is hosted on DigitalOcean and I didn‚Äôt have the permissions to run the `ALTER` command:

    ALTER SYSTEM SET max_stack_depth = '4MB';
    ---
    permission denied to set parameter ""max_stack_depth""

(I contacted DigitalOcean via a support ticket and they promptly provided a solution, I can alter the value using their web API).

Then, I started to analyze the problem.

The first thing I tried was to run the same query as plain SQL against the database using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and it perfectly worked.

This was suspicious, it means that probably Prisma was executing a query too complex and expensive.

Then, I refactored the code, using the Prisma method `$queryRaw` to run the same query, and it worked!

At this point, I didn‚Äôt want to manually define all the type for the values returned by the query, and I thought of using a new cool feature of Prisma called [TypedSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

This way I can run a Raw Query against the database with the types automatically generated by Prisma for me.

So, in the end, I refactored to code, and avoided to increase the value `max_stack_depth` that would have increased the memory consumption in general.

**Conclusion**

I hope that this post was useful, and it avoids you from spending hours on troubleshooting these kind of errors with Prisma.

Overall my experience with the tool has been very good and exciting, and I see how they are releasing new versions, features, and improvements.

You can find the [documentation of Prisma at this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

As a side note, I‚Äôm not affiliated with Prisma in any way, I‚Äôm just a happy user of the product.

webdev,Scraping keywords from webpages - method suggestions wanted,"Hi All,

I'm making a keyword scraper in order to do some competitor research on the top google search results. I've come here to ask for your ideas on the best ways to extract the most important keywords from a page I'll detail what I'm currently doing below.

This is all done in python using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

1. Get the text from all visible elements
2. Delete the first header and all of the following elements: footers, navs and elements with ""aria-hidden=True""
3. Flattens all inline elements so that the text is all in block level elements -&gt; just done for ease of parsing
4. Then it creates 8 lists
   1. A list where each of the h1-6 elements are collected
   2. A list for roughly the first 200 words measured from the start of the first h1
   3. A list for all elements after the start of the first h1
5. I then return a dictionary to my keyword scraper which has all of the lists above plus the title, url and meta description

Then I run my langauge processing which is a combo of SciKit learn and SpaCy.

I have three methods currently working to extract keywords:

* TF-IDF -&gt; TfidfVectorizer from sklearn
* Noun-Phrase extraction -&gt; I'll post my matcher below but this is a custom pipeline for spaCy
* Named entity extraction -&gt; spaCy as well, super basic just collecting important types of named entities like person, product etc...

Here is my matcher:

    patterns = [
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Optional Adverb(s) + Adjective(s) + Noun(s)
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': 'ADV', 'OP': '*'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '+'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Nouns joined by coordinating conjunction
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'CCONJ'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}, 'OP': '+'}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Gerund + Noun
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': 'VERB', 'TAG': 'VBG'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Noun + Preposition + Optional Adjective + Noun
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'ADP'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': 'ADJ', 'OP': '*'},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{'POS': {'IN': ['NOUN', 'PROPN']}}],
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # ¬†Noun + Hyphen + Verb/Noun
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† [{""POS"": ""NOUN""},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{""TEXT"": ""-""},
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†{""POS"": {""IN"": [""NOUN"", ""VERB""]}}]
    ¬†]

This collects a decent amount of keywords but I feel like it could be improved. Has anyone else approached this problem and has any advice on new methods I can try I'd love to hear about.

Are there ways of doing this I'm missing, which don't involve buying new domains?

webdev,Error 403 forbidden,"I am creating my own website, using the tutorial at [this link](https://sive.rs/ti). All went very smoothly, until recently. I purchased a domain name, got server space from Vultr, and created an SSH key. The problem started when I went through [step 6](https://sive.rs/ti#web1)  of the tutorial. I downloaded the files successfully, then used FreeFileSync to upload the htdocs folder to the server. I mirrored the /home/me/htdocs folder with the /var/www folder on the server side. I see the htdocs folder on the server side now, but when I go to my domain I get a 403 forbidden error.

webdev,PSA: You are good enough !,"I am not sure why I felt compelled to write this post.

Perhaps it is the long unemployment stint I have been on and the rough interview loops I've been enduring or maybe I just needed the cathartic release.

Either way, I want to take those who are interested down memory lane with me and reflect on a past experience of mine that helps me through tough times like these.

It all started many years ago when I worked at a company with another developer. Lets call him Robert. Robert was by no means a super star developer but he was an amazingly nice person and was a pleasure to work with.

However, he did not show qualities I would expect of a top developer.  No great understanding of CS. Not an algorithmic god. Minimal knowledge of craftmanship aspects in software. No extensive knowledge of building systems. He was just an everyday developer.

One day Robert gets called by a FANG adjacent recruiter telling him that a team is interested in hiring him.

What was different about this situation was the recruiter did not send him through the front door.  His interview loop consisted of 3 calls. 1 recruiter screen, 1 call with the hiring manager, 1 call with the wider team.

He did not have to endure a single technical round (I don't want to go into the circumstances of why as I don't want to dox myself)

He of course takes this offer and starts a month later. I was very happy for him and wished him the best and that was that.

Fast forward to today. I am sitting here going through the trenches. 6 round loops. OA, code, system design, behavioural. The whole sh\*t fest.

Occasionally, the doubts creep in. Am I good enough ? should I throw in the towel and go into the #trades ? is my experience worthless ?

Then I always think back to our boy Robert.

Roberts rare and unique story showed me that a vast number of developers can likely excel in any position given the chance (even big tech).

I just wanted to say that you are good enough.

The interview practices we endure are nothing more than a filter to whittle down the demand.

When you fail an interview you are doing just that, failing a filter. It has no bearing on you, your ability, or your identity. Like Robert, if you could jump past all the interview mess you would be just fine (As an aside, I believe that Robert would likely not have made it through the traditional interview loop for the same position.)

Anyways, I hope you liked my story and wish you all the best if you are going through it also.

Lastly, I realise this post comes across bitter and jealous. It is not my intention (although perhaps I am a little). I am just a beaten-down dev struggling through it. I wish Robert the best and hope he is happy and killing it.",Invisible_Wetface,1h3deuo,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3deuo/psa_you_are_good_enough/,2024-11-30 14:13:55,51,0.8,51,0,17,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3deuo
webdev,I want to publish an Azure function from a Monorepo,"I am a long term Azure functions user and I have properly created, published, and maintained infrastructure that relied on Azure functions. My process is usually very similar.

I scaffold a basic Azure function (version 4, typescript, http trigger) from the Visual Studio Code Azure extension, I modify the default function with my code, build it with npm run build which is just a tsc command, run it with func start, test it by hitting the API with Postman, and then it's time to publish it to my Azure dashboard on my Azure account.

To publish this correctly functioning Azure function, I run a command like this that actually creates the function instance `az functionapp create --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --consumption-plan-location LOCATION_CODE --runtime node --name FUNCTION_AZURE_NAME --storage-account STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --os-type Linux` , then I run something like `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the root directory of the function repo to actually push up the function to my Azure account.

I recently decided that it would be more convenient to start putting all of my Azure functions into 1 monorepo. It was getting hard to keep track of all of the Github repos of single purpose Azure functions. I used NX to make this monorepo.

I found this project [https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure](https://github.com/AlexPshul/nxazure) , which allows you to scaffold Azure functions into an NX repo. I ran `npx create-nx-workspace@latest` to create the repo and followed the prompts to make a blank repo.

I made the Azure function in question with these commands:

    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:init FUNCTION_DIRECTORY
    npx nx g u/nxazure/func:new FUNCTION_NAME --project=FUNCTION_DIRECTORY --template=""HTTP trigger""

The function works great locally and I'm able to run it just fine with the NX supplied build and run commands. I can hit the APIs locally with Postman, just like when I scaffolded the functions with the Visual Studio Code extension. The problem is that when it comes time to publish the function to my Azure account, the NX supplied publish command does nothing. It doesn't even error, it succeeds with 0 functions uploaded to Azure.

My best theory on why this is happening lies in the build output structure for @ nxazure/func as opposed to the build structure of the Visual Studio Code extension. The Visual Studio Code build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsrc
        ‚îÇ   index.js
        ‚îÇ   index.js.map
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄfunctions
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js
                MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

But the @ nxazure/func build structure outputs something like this:

    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt; tree .\packages\MYFUNCTIONDIRECTORYNAME\dist\ /f
    Folder PATH listing
    \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory\DIST
    ‚îÇ   tsconfig.base.json
    ‚îÇ   
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄpackages
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄbTSOrdAddrsCreate
            ‚îÇ   _registerPaths.js
            ‚îÇ   _registerPaths.js.map        
            ‚îÇ   
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄsrc
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄfunctions
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js    
                        MYFUNCTIONNAME.js.map
    
    PS \Path\To\This\Functions\Directory&gt;

With the `func` command, you only need to run `func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_NAME` in the same directory as the dist folder and the function will be automatically uploaded to your Azure dashboard/account. Maybe that command expects the `dist` folder to have an `index.js` file within the first level of the folder? I'm not quite sure what the publish command is actually doing under the hood.

In short, how do I successfully execute a publish command for a function build in an NX monorepo that was scaffolded with @ nxazure/func? If there is no way to do it via a simple command from the parent directory of the function or at the root of the monorepo, is there a roundabout way to compile the function to a zip and use some command to upload that to my Azure account/dashboard?",warpanomaly,1h3y2eb,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3y2eb/i_want_to_publish_an_azure_function_from_a/,2024-12-01 07:31:58,2,1.0,2,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3y2eb

webdev,"Tried building a critical and complex home page using several AI autocomplete tools, and here are my findings","( i am hoping, this is useful for this group, and if its not , i am happy to take it down )

I used BlackBox AI, V0, and Claude simultaneously. I have paid subscriptions for V0, Claude, and ChatGPT, while BlackBox seems to use ChatGPT by default without linking it to my chat gpt account.

**Winner:**¬†For me, Claude was the clear winner, though it‚Äôs missing a few features compared to the others.

**What I learned about time savings:**¬†I‚Äôm not great at creative coding from scratch, so using these tools made things much easier. It would have taken me 3 workdays to achieve what I did in a 4-hour session split between the tools. Although AI-generated code still needs review‚ÄîI wouldn't fully trust it‚Äîmaking things responsive using AI saved significant time compared to if I had written everything manually or cleaned up an HTML template. Going forward, I think I can be 3x more productive with Claude, especially now that it understands my project context.

**BlackBox AI:**¬†The main reason to explore BlackBox AI was its VS Code integration, which the others don‚Äôt offer. I started generating code on the website, then moved to the VS Code extension. Unfortunately, even with the extension, the improvement process was slow, and ultimately it delivered about 1/10th of the results of Claude or V0.

**Advantages:**¬†Easy code export, since everything‚Äôs already local.

**V0:**¬†V0 feels like me‚Äîit gets overwhelmed and forgets past discussions. Fixing a bug at one step only to see it return after another adjustment was a common frustration. The interface is clean, and the ability to resize the screen was useful for comparing mobile vs. desktop views. However, some persistent issues included:

* Compilation errors were frequent, though reporting them usually led to fixes. Ideally, it should self-correct.
* Filters would sometimes render incorrectly after a few more feature additions.
* Exporting code is made unnecessarily difficult. It‚Äôs not much better in Claude, but with V0 it seems intentional.
* Deployment is easy but seems intended to lock users into the V0 ecosystem, which becomes problematic when scaling to 100-200 files, no more easy way to export except 1 file at a time.

**Claude:**¬†Claude‚Äôs UI is cleaner, and it understands my requests better, making adjustments seamless. There were no compilation errors, and changes were stable. The output was visually clearer, and I'm starting to trust the quality of the changes it makes. Although export isn‚Äôt straightforward.

Overall, Claude‚Äôs consistency and quality make it my preferred tool. It‚Äôs stable, efficient, and I think I can use it to be significantly more productive moving forward.",HurryFormal7067,1h3webg,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3webg/tried_building_a_critical_and_complex_home_page/,2024-12-01 05:41:26,0,0.47,0,0,8,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h3webg

What‚Äôs a realistic budget for a project like this?

How long would it typically take to build, assuming the requirements are clear?



# Communication and Collaboration:

How can I ensure the freelancer understands my vision?

Should I prepare a detailed question catalog and database structure beforehand, or can they help me with that?



Technology and Maintenance:

What should I set up technically to ensure the site is easy to maintain in the long run?

Should I plan for ongoing collaboration with the freelancer for updates and maintenance?

How to stay safe and handle rules or password? 

I plan to run the project on WordPress , hosted on google cloud and integrate the AI chatbot (Dialogflow or OpenAI API), but I‚Äôm open to better alternatives if suggested.

2. I listed things like setting up VPS and NginX, does that have any influence for a frontend position?
3. Since ChatGPT was used, is it obvious for a native? Would you change wordings?
4. I finished CS50x course by Harvard a year ago and I have their free certificate, does it count as a proper education and will it be best to include it in this CV?
5. Skills section, some of the things look funny to me, should I keep simple things like CSS and HTML in it or remove them, anything big missing?

webdev,[Showoff Saturday] I made a simple blindfold chess app,"Hi everyone, I'd like to share a side project I've been working on: [Blindfold Chess](http://playblindfoldchess.com).

**What is this app?**

It's a chess app that doesn't have a board! Play chess against the AI (driven by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)), but you must visualize the board in your head. The app provides menu-like inputs to select what pieces to move and where to move them, but it doesn't give any hints as to where the pieces are or what moves they can make. When the game's over, you can copy the moves to the clipboard and open them in an app that lets you visualize chess games.

**Why I made this app**

I learned how to play chess as a child, but I only started actually playing about two years ago. I studied a few openings back then and read two introductory books, but I've mainly just been playing casually. After a few months of playing, I challenged chat gpt to play a game of chess, and instead of showing a chessboard, it just said ""e4"". That was my first introduction to blindfold chess, and I found it highly challenging but not impossible to visualize the board, so I was interested in improving that skill. Unfortunately, chat gpt wasn't able to play coherent games and would inevitably begin making illegal moves as a game progresses.

I made my own chess AI a while back after and used that to play blindfold chess, but I've abandoned that project. Recently, after about a year or so since that last project, I began this. I'm a bit out of practice at the moment, but I expect that I'll improve over time so long as I play a game every day or so.

Surprisingly, I haven't found any apps that do what this does: provide a simple interface for playing blindfold chess. It's certainly niche, but I don't think it's so niche to the point that nobody would have made this simply for that reason. In any case, I'm curious to see if it actually gains adoption, or if I'm the only one who will actually use this on a regular basis.

**Future plans**

First and foremost, once the app has matured a bit, I'm going to make an Android app, then work to make an Android smartwatch app. I've done some preliminary performance tests and have determined that, if nothing else, a Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartwatch can handle the game in easy mode without taking too long to make moves.

After I improve my ability to play blindfold chess, I'd like to write up an article or two that discusses tactics and strategies to help you visualize the board. If there's interest, I might add a feature to play another human locally (i.e., you'd pass them the phone and they'd input their move). Technically, if two people are playing blindfold chess, they wouldn't need the phone at all, but if they disagree about where certain pieces are, the phone would provide an answer to that. I don't think I'll implement a capability to play online because of how easy it would be to cheat, but if people actually play on this app and request it, I'd consider adding it.

I'd also like to add a feature to speak moves and have the system recognize and execute them, but that's a lower priority.",brandon-quinn-author,1h3e04o,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h3e04o/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_simple_blindfold_chess/,2024-11-30 14:44:15,3,0.72,3,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Showoff Saturday,self,t3_1h3e04o

They act as notification channels (like emails)‚Äîwhich is helpful for many teams‚Äîbut they still leave a lot for teams to figure out themselves, such as fair code review distribution, back-and-forth communication (like I left new comments - I replied to your comments) and reminders.

This is what ReviewNudgeBot offers on top of very convenient and noise-free notifications:

* **Reminders for reviewers blocking PR progress**: When a PR is left without a review, reviewers‚Äô comments are replied to, or a new commit is pushed to the PR, reviewers are reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Reminders for authors blocking PR progress**: When reviewers request changes, new comments are added to a PR, or a build fails, the author is reminded after some time of inactivity.
* **Auto-assign reviewer**: After a few team reminders to review a PR, the bot selects specific reviewers and reminds them to review the PR. This helps resolve the bystander effect.
* **Escalate notification**: The bot can be configured to notify a manager if a PR sits for too long without reviews.

* **Tag:** Navigate through tags and delete with 'Backspace'
* **Input:** Move the input position to add new elements between existing ones

The library also supports custom keybinds for adding elements, custom tag elements &amp; custom styling.

webdev,New company has clients point by nameserver instead of A record? There has to be a better way.,"Hey everyone, I recently started working at a website development company and ran into something that feels unnecessarily complicated. Here‚Äôs the situation:

When we build a website for a client, we ask them to point their domain to our **nameservers** so the website can go live. This means we end up managing their entire DNS, even though we‚Äôre just the website provider. It's an extra burden, especially when clients request changes for things like email or subdomains.

I asked why we don‚Äôt just have clients point their domain to our server using an **A record**, and here‚Äôs the explanation I got:

‚ÄúIf we ever need to change our server‚Äôs IP address (which has happened a couple of times), all clients would need to update their A record to the new IP. That‚Äôs impractical with thousands of clients. Nameservers avoid this issue because we can make IP changes behind the scenes without involving the client.‚Äù

Okay, that makes sense, but using nameservers feels inefficient for so many other reasons... I feel like there has to be a better way to solve this problem without the extra workload.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts considering my role at the company isn't as technical but this workflow is hugely affecting my output and I want to offer them a better solution. What‚Äôs the most practical way to minimize client disruption while reducing our DNS management responsibilities?",ZeusBabylonski,1h2oz0r,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2oz0r/new_company_has_clients_point_by_nameserver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2oz0r/new_company_has_clients_point_by_nameserver/,2024-11-29 16:02:56,27,0.82,27,0,33,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1h2oz0r

I create a platform slatesource.com which allows users to create web pages easily by using modules.

It took a long time to develop the concept and tweak the foundations to get to a point where managing those modules are quite easy. Currently only simple tabs are developed in the prototype such as Overview, Tasks or Timeline but in the future I plan to release more complex tabs such as Transactions, Shop, Teams, etc.. 

Imagine a website being built as easily as going grocery shopping and just grabbing the tabs you need. Building a non profit organisation? Get some Overview and Goals. Startup? Roadmap + Team. Photography Portfolio? Gallery + Links. Etc..

webdev,New technology in prod fears,"I'm wondering if anyone else has fears of trying new tech in prod. I'm not just talking about trying out a new library. I'm talking about standing up stuff that you've never really used in prod before.

I feel like I can play around with new tech locally but I always fear that there must be some prod specific stuff that I'm missing. Extra load revealing issues, incorrect assumptions made, config stuff that I'm expected to know but don't, etc. I tend to use stuff I'm familiar with just because there are some bugs that have been really hard to figure out. Managers have asked before *how* a bug could ***possibly*** be introduced, and the thought of saying, ""eh, this is just my first time using it and I'm learning"" sounds like a good way to get on someone's shitty developer list. Most managers that I've had seem to think that any bug is just completely unacceptable, so the thought of admitting to incompetence or ignorance seems like out of the question.

Do most of you just stick with shit you know, or do you take the plunge if you think something might be better? Or go with something new that might work just as well but also save some paint points from existing tech? I'm not talking about going with new stuff just because it's new.

  
**Example**

I used to work at a place with multiple applications. I was talking to someone on another team in the enterprise one day about their architecture. This team literally didn't use a load balancer to load balance between different servers. They literally made separate URLs for the internal team to use. If one server went down, they would launch up the other and tell the internal customers to go the other URL. Load balancing is SO basic and it used to strike me as extremely weird that they wouldn't just add that in. I can imagine that it might be really scary for them though because of how critical the app was, and you could really screw up production if you messed up your session management setup. You might set up the load balancer and show that you're hitting the servers and that the website is working well, and then totally not do anything about session management. It hits production and then it's a disaster! Ok - you see errors and then you just shut down the other servers and you're pretty much back where you started. Not the end of the world but hopefully you see my point.",wannacommissionameme,1h35jrd,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h35jrd/new_technology_in_prod_fears/,2024-11-30 05:28:34,0,0.5,0,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1h35jrd

webdev,Common data fetching in a layout and a page in ReactJS,"I have been thinking about data fetching of front end. Suppose you have

\- Layout: it resource A to render a sidebar

\- Page: it is in the layout. It needs resource A and B

Resource is stored globally in an app (with whatever, Redux or Context). Resource A may be fetched again on a user event like when \`userId\` changes.  
Page A should not know what layout fetches, vice versa. They should care only data they need.

How is it possible to fetch resource A only once?

If you put this \`useEffect\` in a layout and a page, it fetches when \`userId\` changes. A problem is that they may race in a layout and a page. They may run simultaneously.

\`\`\`  
useEffect(() =&gt; {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}, \[dispatch, userId\]);

\`\`\`

Putting another \`useEffect \` does not seem to solve a problem. You will not know when \`useEffect\` runs, no matter it is in a layout or in a page. If only a page waits until layout finishes loading, it would work, but it does not.

\`\`\`

useEffect(() =&gt; {

if (resourceAStatus === 'idle') {

dispatch(fetchResourceA({ id: userId }));

}

}, \[dispatch, resourceAStatus \]);

\`\`\`

One simple way is ""Fetch data in layout, not in page at all"", but it is not a good practice. You should fetch data when you need it.

Does anyone know a good data fetching design?

**Repost Story:**

Back in 2017, I was fresh out of highschool, not a dollar to my name. I had just signed up for the first semester of college as a CS student when disaster struck my family. Mom and dad both lost their jobs and became deathly sick to the point that they were unable to work. As a result, we became homeless and had to move in with some family friends.

I was working at a barista at Dunkin Doughnuts at the time, my day would consist of waking up at unglodly hours of the morning to catch the bus before the sun came up for my morning shift. After work I would study coding online and work on my college classes.¬†

One day I came home and got the call that my mom had been admitted to the hospital because she was minutes away from having a stroke and her lungs were filled with blood clots. I knew it was either make money or bust, so I started applying to hundreds of coding jobs while studying on sites like pluralsight to prepare. After hundreds of submissions, I finally got a callback for an interview.

I was nervous, stumbling my words, After an hour of coding, I got it to work. I went home, and recieved a callback the next day with an offer for the job.

There I was, a 19 year old homeless broke kid who had just landed his first real job in tech.

Since them I've mannaged to work for some big name companies like Hulu+, Disney, and Warner bros and launched a successful software business, I dropped out of college when I got the first job offer as a sophmore in college. I don't have a degree, or any special certifications, parents didn't give me any money.

I found that when I talk with people about my story in person they are very interested, so I figured I'd post online to see if my expereince can help anyone else learn from it so ask away.

webdev,Is it fine to find your own way of a ‚Äòworkaround‚Äô?,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing a next js website where it has some forms using shadcn/ui

So one of the form fields has countries list, which are over 170 elements in an array. While creating them with shadcn combobox or select, the website lags for a second because of the number of the html elements loaded for each country, but doesn‚Äôt lag on normal &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, however I need to have custom styling for it.

I did some research and came across something called virtualization with tanstack or react-window, but applying them threw many errors and it was just a headache

So what I did is, stored the array in a state with a slice(0,10) and once opened, I set the state to fill all of the countries.

Now this method works well, the combobox doesn‚Äôt lag, and everything is smooth, but is this fine to do?

I mean definitely there are better practices than what I did, but is this fine to continue with or should I reconsider my approach?

webdev,Trying to break out of the field while simultaneously unemployed. Advise?,"I am a senior web dev (NodeJS, RoR) that has recently lost their job unexpectedly for the first time in forever. I live in the EU, in a country that does not have a lot of jobs, and what little can be found has a lot of competition, is underpaid, and you get worked to the bone. Up until this point I was working fully remote for other EU companies and was starting to make a decent living as an EM. When I lost my job I tried to keep that momentum going, but long story short, it's quite difficult and there is higher need for developers than there is for other roles.

I used my unemployment time to pick up Python which turned out great, successfully acing two different coding challenges and reaching the next stage in the pipeline. However, it seems that growing into Python further would involve delving into pretty specific and uninteresting libraries (django, or numpy or pandas).

Context over, now to the matter at hand. I am quite tired of web dev. It's why I ventured into Python in the first place. With time on my hands, I have it in me to pick up another language. To spare you the details, I believe these are the two avenues that might make sense:

\- Refresh in-demand, web only languages. This obviously snuffs out what little soul I have left. Refresh PHP. Or refresh NodeJS/TypeScript. Much better than PHP, but still quite boring. There are a lot of PHP, NodeJS, RoR jobs, but there are also a lot of candidates.

\- Try my hand at C#. Interesting, can think of very enticing projects! I am confident I could pick it up. Potentially moves me away from web dev. But my CV has no single a single speck of C#, so I would not be looked as a solid candidate.

webdev,Issue with vertically centered content shifting on wrap,"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm stuck and was hoping someone could help. Essentially, I have a splash/landing page with a logo. The logo is an SVG, it's vertically and horizontally centered. That all works great.

I have a little JavaScript that types in a byline type description under it. It's short. But on mobile screens, it wraps to the next line, which is fine. Only issue is that when it wraps, the element (H1) then shifts the logo above it upwards so the image, and now two lines of text are all vertically centered.

I'd like the text to just go downwards when wrapping without pushing the group of the content upwards.

Here's what I have currently. We're using Bootstrap 5.

Edit: I can see that putting the JS inside the section groups it with the logo to be centered, but we've tried it outside as well and same.

    &lt;section id=""landing"" class=""landing bg-light d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center vh-100""&gt;

    &lt;/section&gt;

The CSS:

    .landing .landing-logo {
    ¬† width: clamp(300px, 50%, 916px);
    }
    
    .typing-text {
    ¬† font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 2.5vw, 2.5rem);

So, when releasing into Prod, you have to pick a Dev PR that was approved by QA... but then that build still could have items unapproved in it.

webdev,Where did the Python jobs go?,"I started using Python for building web sites and web-based applications back around 2009, after switching away from PHP. Over time, I moved into other technologies but it all still used HTTP under the hood.

Recently, I started looking into backend dev jobs to see whats out there. I was very surprised that Python doesn't appear in-demand anymore; especially for backend development. 

Most roles I see are looking for Go, Typescript, C# and so forth. And they aren't open to hiring without their tech-of-choice in your resume.

Has anyone else notice this change? Any idea what happened and when/why businesses decided to move away? Or am I just overlooking a whole set of jobs?",codeandtrees,1h2qecj,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2qecj/where_did_the_python_jobs_go/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1h2qecj/where_did_the_python_jobs_go/,2024-11-29 17:06:01,0,0.44,0,0,38,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1h2qecj
webdev,"Is front end development dying [NOT duplicate, serious topic]","I'm sure there are lots of more exprienced developers out there, since I was professionally in the industry for 3 years now and I was working freelance before but things have gone much worse from my perspective. 

I'm not going to start AI will make us homeless stuff, but the way is front end viewed is the problem.

I think it is a nail in the coffin for this field. imagine this. so, we have backend colleagues. they are getting paid more than us and more important than that, they have PRESTIGE. 

even if they write a simple SELECT query, the employer and others think that it is a rocket science or something, but for a front end developers... "" it is just a simple button bro "". 

it almost took me 2 months to optimize the prescription section of our medical web app. we've had heavy lists and extremely dynamic forms and technical challenges.. but we've done something extremely good. 

and now after 2 months the only thing I heard from my boss was "" this was the least you can do, it is just a simple button "" 

and I don't blame him to be fair. this is what most of the industry thinks. 

  
I feel like the blue collar part of the developer society. you took the most effort, get paid less and no one values your job. 

and even worse than that, compared to Java or C# (Scala or .NET Core), front end is just a shit party! no rules, no strong foundation and god forbid for example if Vercel rolls out a new update and changes the whole structure of the framework! 

on the other hand, from my personal experience, I really enjoy reading .NET core documents. everything is very well structured and you don't have to give blow job  for AI or Stackoverflow developers to get your answer.

just a great Microsoft community. 

  
so, my question is... is it worth it? really after 3 years and couple years of freelance, I just started to regret my choice. 

it was like that in 2016 let's say...

webdev, Have you been affected by Redis license changes?,"Trying to gather some information for our library, will appreciate any comment and opinion.



Have you been affected by Redis license changes directly or indirectly?

If so, did you move to ValKey, or considering it?

If you moved or will move, considering the fact that most of the used clients are under Redis org, what is your plan with the client you use?

Would you change the client? To a fork or consider to change completely?

In case the current client stops supporting ValKey, would the answer change?

webdev,Best way to start with a monolith while planning for future microservices?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm planning to start my project with a monolithic architecture but want to make sure the transition to microservices in the future will be manageable.

What are the best practices, design patterns, or tools I should consider to ensure the monolith is built in a way that supports a smooth transition?

I‚Äôd appreciate any insights or advice from those who‚Äôve taken this approach.

webdev,Need help with scalability of app with dynamic data source,"I‚Äôm building a production dashboard where each part (e.g., bar chart) needs to fetch data from dynamic sources like SQL, APIs, and IoT devices. These sources are specified in a configuration file, and they can change over time. I need the app to handle these changes with minimal maintenance.

Here‚Äôs my current approach: I separate a quantity/time bar chart into two components: quantity and time. Each component is tied to its own plugin for different data sources (SQL, API, IoT). This results in more than six plugins just to update a single bar chart  because the data updates often require mixing and matching different data sources (e.g., SQL + IoT or API + SQL), i need to create additional plugin to handle new combination of data sources

As the number of plugins grows, it‚Äôs becoming harder to maintain. How can I improve this approach to make the system more scalable and easier to manage, while still allowing flexibility in changing and mixing data sources from the config file for each component?

webdev,Noob here‚Äîwhy is my web app hitting database limits real quick? ,"Hi,

I‚Äôm building a worker roster management web app with around 600 workers. Right now, every time I view the roster, it reads the entire database, and the reads quickly add up to the firebase free limit. This seems inefficient, but I‚Äôm not sure how to fix it.

The backend is on Railway, the database is on Firebase, and I‚Äôm considering moving to DigitalOcean for better scalability and cost control. Before making that move, I‚Äôd like advice on:

How to optimise database reads for a roster app.

Whether moving to DigitalOcean or another platform would help with costs or efficiency.

Any tips or recommendations?
