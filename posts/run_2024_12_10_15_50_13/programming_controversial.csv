Hey there,

For the past few months, I‚Äôve been working on an open-source library for creating faceless videos.

I‚Äôm considering turning it into an API so developers can easily integrate it by simply providing the script in scenes.

The API would generate:
	‚Ä¢	Voice
	‚Ä¢	Images
	‚Ä¢	Transitions
	‚Ä¢	Captions

I‚Äôm thinking of pricing it at around $0.10 per minute rendered to cover AI generation costs.

Is this something you‚Äôd be willing to pay for?
