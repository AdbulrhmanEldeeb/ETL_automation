pcgaming,Our World War II airbase builder got a new demo with new major features,"Hello r/pcgaming, my team and I are making a base builder set on World War II military airfields, called [Ground of Aces](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/). In this game, you build your own air base, manage your ground crew and aircraft, and send your pilots out on missions.

And we just released a **major update for our**[ **demo on Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/) with new features and content.

The key updates are:

* Four new aircraft: Avro Lancaster, Bristol Blenheim, Bristol Beaufighter, Gloster Gladiator
* Expanded mission systems with new missions and mission types
* Plane maintenance system, incl. fuel as a new resource, multi seat plane logic and pilot class and task system
* New metal building blocks for hangars, fences, fuel tanks
* Gardening system that lets you grow plants and harvest your own food
* and many more improvements

Play the demo here:[ https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground\_of\_Aces/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308690/Ground_of_Aces/)

Here is an overview video of the new Alpha 3 features:[ https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R](https://youtu.be/IrwReHTBIIg?si=b28FxPjOaOGnRV0R)

As a big fan of base building games like Rimworld and as a World War II aviation nerd, this is a passion project for me. Almost 10 years ago, I had the idea of a base builder game set on World War II airbases, and it feels unreal to see this idea coming to life now and have people play this alpha version of the game.

We are in the alpha phase of development, so everything is still a work in progress. It would be **great to hear your opinion and feedback about the demo**. Is it satisfying to collect resources and build your first structures? How long did you play and how big did your air base get? Anything in particular you like/dislike about the experience? Getting early feedback helps the ongoing development and will make the game better for everyone.
