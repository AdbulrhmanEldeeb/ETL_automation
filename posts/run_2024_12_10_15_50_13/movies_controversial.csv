movies,I’ve rewatched “Law Abiding Citizen” 3 times,"3 times now… I love this movie so much. It’s intense to say the least. The first time I was really confused on the entire timeline of events and what was actually happening. This guy was miserably failed by the justice system for the murder and r*pe of his daughter and wife, he took matters into his own hands and made sure every single authority figure who was involved in the case faced consequences. This flick is for sure on my top 5 favorites. It’s one of those movies that keep you locked on the screen the entire time. Highly recommend.

movies,Juror #2 Thoughts,"Wondering if anyone else has seen this yet.

I personally was really excited for it, based on both the reviews, the director and a solid cast with JK Simmons, Nicholas Hoult and that chick from the sixth sense. If nothing else, a good courtroom drama is always hard to beat.

Watched it last night and was so utterly confused by the praise this movie has gotten. The plot was ludicrous even for a hollywood film, every secondary character's dialogue was incredibly obnoxious and no I every standard clique/trope was left untouched.

All I can figure is that people believe this is Clint Eastwood's last movie and are being nice; nobody wants to send him to the afterlife with a movie that is 25% fresh with an IMDb of 5.4. Or am I offbase here?

movies,La La Land’s (2016) ending sequence is one of the best uses of a no-dialogue scene in major modern film since the beginning of Up (2009),"I just finished a rewatch of La La Land and was reminded just how amazing the ending is, when Mia stumbles across Seb’s club and sees him for the first time since they parted ways all those years ago.

Despite having seen the movie before, the sequence that shows how one of them would’ve ended up unhappy if they stayed together still manages to make a strong emotional impact. In an overall amazing film, this ending sequence still manages to stand out as one of the most beautiful and rememberable parts of this movie. As someone who lost a person I was in love with too young and imagined how things would’ve played out in other circumstances, I can’t watch this scene without tearing up and am sure a lot of other people can relate. Upon rewatching, I have a much greater appreciation for the eloquent and simply stunning way in which they were able to portray the complex feelings of thinking about what could’ve been, and ill-fated love. 

The way that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were able to convey so much emotion through just their movements and facial expressions was a testimony to their talent. Of course, the slowed down piano version of City of Stars also plays in a big role in setting the mood for this scene and is a gorgeous score. It’s hard to think of another movie that captures such a perfect balance of being bittersweet. 

I know it’s strange to compare La La Land to an animated children’s movie, but I couldn’t help but thinking about Up (2009) while rewatching the ending. The beginning of Up that shows how Carl met and lost his wife with no dialogue had people of all age groups in tears when the movie was released. These two scenes are both uniquely special in the way they’re able to convey strong emotions and make an impact on the audience while using no dialogue. 

Barring actual silent films, can anyone else think of a scene in a movie that manages to pack an emotional punch with no dialogue on the level of La La Land and Up? Any thoughts about La La Land and its ending?

The soundtrack is excellent, and overall tone is suitably foreboding when it needs to be. The ""pirate speak"" could be better, but it is obviously aimed at kids.

It's got a lot of the charm of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and follows the time-tested Moby Dick format while staying fairly original. It's got a very classic feel that reminds me of the old swashbuckling pirate films of the 80s. Its a proper adventure film.

So when Elisabeth (Demi) is told about substance she is advise “you are one” with your other self, so I was watching the movie as if her consciousness has been transferred into Sue, however later in the movie I realised Elisabeth has no recollection of what Sue does when she was watching the interview on tv she was shocked and livid and clearly hearing it for the first time. Sue is also shocked to find the mess in the apartment that Elisabeth left behind her, so she has no recollection of Elisabeth’s experiences. . So Sue is basically a clone of Elisabeth. 

But then we also see Elisabeth run into the older version of guy nurse with hand mark, and he talks to her as if he himself met her with recollection of their meeting, so in that case it’s clearly not a clone. So my question is which is it? Why do Elisabeth/Sue actually do seem separate while the other guy isn’t? But the bigger question is if you are Elisabeth, you don’t actually get to experience being young again, you go to sleep for a week wasting away, why would anyone want to just clone themselves and keep going when they don’t get anything out of it?!

movies,Favorite movie by european country: Turkey,"Hello there,

since more than 40 days I ask you for your favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Switzerland's turn and it was certainly not the first try to bring the *Three colours*\-trilogy into the game, but now, finally, quasi at the last opportunity, it made the cut: ***Trois couleurs: Rouge*** (engl.: Three colours: Red) will be the next entry on our official letterboxd list. 

What comes next? Well, we'll see - here in this thread. I am following the alphabetical order of the Council of Europe's official list of European countries here, which means, on the one hand, that we're yet to get to England and the like (stay tuned), but on the other hand it also means that today we are  talking about a country that is only partially part of geographical Europe: I'm looking for movies set in **Turkey**. But even in this case, there are only two rules to follow when approaching this country from a cinematic perspective:

* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.
* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

I don’t know why, but I truly love this movie. I really do. I watched it long ago when it came out during a shit time in my life in bed with my dogs and alone on the Hollidays. I was a young 22 year old or something lol. 
So maybe that’s why it just locks in my heart lol.

The movie to me works because it’s pretty normal to me. My family was like this. Very blended. All different. My mom was welcoming of anyone and I think there’s just a lot of things covered in this movie that make sense. 

I’m sure I stand alone in loving this movie. But, if your like me and come from a family that’s far from picture perfect &amp; you have a close bond with your siblings. I would give it a watch.

Honestly, it isn't a great movie, but it's completely watchable in a just-above-Sci-Fi-Original sort of way. I appreciated that they made a sincere attempt to make a southern gothic-flavored folk horror film, and some of the atmosphere is effectively spooky. However, the CGI is pretty bad and it's pretty clear that most of what we're seeing is fake, which drags it down. 

Despite me finding it passable enough, I'm really worried that this is the future of Hellboy in live action. There are countless Hellboy stories that could be adapted into good low budget horror movies, but this franchise will probably end up like the DTV era of Hellraiser where they make a movie every few years just to retain the rights. The character isn't much of a box office draw either, which is a shame as the comics are excellent.

I was very excited to watch Dear Santa because it felt like a wholesome, old school Christmas movie, all I really knew about it was the concept and that one trailer I saw, but that was enough for me.

The movie was just wholesome from beginning to end and at the end, it did it, a story that FINALLY had the courage to and we're heading into end game major spoiler territory here

&gt;!A story that had the courage to DEFY death! THANK YOU to the writers, whoever approved it, thank you!!&lt;

No, this is a fantasy movie, this is a world that someone imagined and in their world this kinda stuff IS possible because the worlds we create in our imagination are ours to write the rules in and the writers did just that. I'm glad that somewhere out there exists a world like this, I wish ours was one but it isn't, but I'm happy just to see this stuff.!&lt;

this is my #1 new Christmas Movie alongside Klaus.

movies,"Now You See Me 3 (2025) - Cast, Release Date - Parade","Now You See Me 3 wasn't delayed because of COVID like the writer claims. The head of Lionsgate notoriously was more interested in hitting specific release dates than making good movies. Writer/director Gary Ross didn't return to direct the sequel to The Hunger Games because Lionsgate wouldn't give him any time to work on the script or do pre-production prep. The sequel ended up going into production without any script at all --the director was shooting pages from the book until a shooting script was cobbled together. Catching Fire was a big hit anyway because of the goodwill generated by the first film but Lionsgate's slapdash approach to production led to diminishing audience interest and box office for the final installment (which was split into two films since that worked for Harry Potter and Twilight).

Before Now You See Me 2 opened Lionsgate announced that part 3 would be going into immediate production and be released the following year --but audiences weren't happy with the sequel which underperformed in North America. Lionsgate claimed the China box office made up for the disappointing returns in North America which clearly wasn't true because the original sequel which was to be helmed by Jon Chu again was cancelled.

In addition to completely screwing up the sequel to Now You See Me Lionsgate did the same with the sequel to the Bruce Willis action comedy R.E.D. Now You See Me and R.E.D. were both developed by Summit Pictures before that company was acquired by Lionsgate.

movies,"December 6-8 Box Office Recap: 'Moana 2' stayed on top of the box office, earning almost $600 million worldwide after just 2 weeks. The 'Interstellar' IMAX re-release earned $4.6 million from just 165 theaters. Meanwhile, A24's 'Y2K' flopped in ninth place with just $2.1 million.","https://preview.redd.it/qi1cxbn2ew5e1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4ef17a901777c7190d7c99319350a23894bbf8

Thanks to the excellent performance last week, this was a fantastic post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office. ***Moana 2*** broke the record for highest post-Thanksgiving weekend at the box office, while ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II*** continued their run. As is typical with the weekend, studios avoid releasing big stuff. The biggest push was A24's ***Y2K***, which delivered one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 2,000 theaters. In contrast, the IMAX re-release of ***Interstellar*** fared much better in just 165 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $128.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 115% from last year, when ***The Boy and the Heron*** opened in North America. It's the best post-Thanksgiving weekend in history.

Without any competition, ***Moana 2*** easily held the top spot with $51.2 million this weekend. That represents a 63% drop, which is a little steeper than usual for the post-Thanksgiving weekend. It's worse than ***Wish*** (61%), ***Frozen II*** (59%), ***Strange World*** (58%), ***Ralph Breaks the Internet*** (54%), ***Frozen*** (53%), ***Encanto*** (52%), and the original ***Moana*** (50%).

Through 12 days, the film has earned $299.3 million domestically, already eclipsing the original ***Moana***. For a comparison, it had a huge start over ***Inside Out 2***, but it's now running almost $60 million behind that through the same point. It should hit $500 million for the holidays, but the $600 million dream appears to be dead.

***Wicked*** stayed at #2, dropping 55% and adding $36.4 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to a fantastic $322.1 million, and it should finish with over $450 million.

***Gladiator II*** dropped a rough 59%, adding $12.5 million this weekend. The film has earned $132.8 million so far, and it's gonna close with a little over $150 million unless the holidays surprise us.

Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** dropped 45%, adding $7 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $85.7 million. We'd like to say it will hit $100 million, but that's pretty much Joever; Amazon announced just today that the film will start streaming on Prime Video this Thursday. That's gonna kill legs.

The Indian film ***Pushpa 2: The Rule*** opened with $4.88 million in 1,245 theaters, which grows to $9.3 million in its first five days.

Paramount re-released Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** in 165 IMAX theaters. It earned a huge $4.6 million in these locations, which translates to a $27K per-theater average. IMAX reported that the 10 screenings that ran the film on 70mm sold out. These numbers took its lifetime gross to $192.6 million.

Sony/Crunchyroll's ***Solo Leveling: ReAwakening*** earned $2.4 million from just $846 theaters. Not bad for a recap of the first season.

Fathom Events released the concert film ***For King + Country’s A Drummer Boy Christmas Live*** in 1,540 theaters, for a limited 4-day run. It finished in eighth place with $2.2 million ($2.8 million four-day).

Debuting in ninth place, we find A24's ***Y2K***, which flopped with just $2.1 million in 2,108 theaters. That's a poor $1,003 per-theater average, suggesting a lot of empty screenings. It is the 33rd worst debut for a film in over 2,000 theaters. 

This shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. The film lacked big names, with the big emphasis on its writer and director, Kyle Mooney. Mooney is definitely well known for ***Saturday Night Live***, but like a lot of stars in the show, that doesn't mean people will flock to watch that star on the screen. Horror is a profitable genre, but the film is actually a horror comedy, making it a tougher sell. A24 takes a lot of risks, but it was clear that this would struggle. Since its SXSW premiere, reviews have been mixed, and they've been worsening (currently at 43% on RT), making it one of the worst titles of the studio. It's simply a film that couldn't find an audience.

According to A24, 58% of the audience was male, and 77% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it an awful ""C–"" on CinemaScore, suggesting the film will fade quickly from theaters. A run under $5 million is a possibility, and the film could be gone from theaters by the time New Year arrives. Not the best years for Rachel Zegler, apparently.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Lionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever***. It fell 53%, adding $1.5 million this weekend and taking its total to $34.4 million.

Outside the Top 10, we find ***Werewolves***, a horror action title with Frank Grillo. It hit 1,351 theaters, but it flopped with just $1 million this weekend. Don't expect it to last long.

Vertical also decided to release Justin Kurzel's ***The Order*** in 603 theaters, but it only made $878,000 this weekend. Ouch.

A24 expanded Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** to 47 theaters. It added $405,910 this weekend, taking its run to $866K after 10 days. It will continue expanding.

Searchlight didn't even bother with ***Nightbitch***. Not only did they dump it in 82 theaters, but they didn't release box office numbers. Le sigh.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Moana 2*** continued leading the box office after its record-breaking weekend. It added $103.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide numbers to $599 million. Its biggest debut was Japan, where it opened with $6.5 million. The best markets so far are France ($32.5M), UK ($27.2M), Germany ($19.7M), Mexico ($19.1M) and Brazil ($16M). A billion is imminent, but it looks like it will take a little while.

While ***Wicked*** registering strong numbers domestically, it continues performing softly overseas. This weekend, it added $26.9 million, taking its worldwide total to $457.5 million. It had very soft debuts in France ($2M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Poland ($900K). The best markets are the UK ($47.4M), Australia ($17.2M), South Korea ($10.6M), Mexico ($8.1M) and Spain ($4.5M). It will open in more markets, but it's not like it will suddenly explode. If it was performing on par with its domestic run, we'd say a billion is a possibility, but that's not the case here. 70% of its money is coming from the domestic market, which is crazy.

***Gladiator II*** added $17 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $368.5 million. The film is slowing down, and while it will hit $400 million, it won't get much further than that. Far below the original's $460 million worldwide total.

***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*** opened in 31 markets, mostly Latin America, a week ahead of its worldwide rollout. To say that it performed badly would be an understatement. The film debuted with an awful $2 million. It had terrible starts in Spain ($347K), Mexico ($239K), Thailand ($146K), Brazil ($106K), and Czech Republic ($103K). Yep, not a single market over $1 million. This suggests the film is heading for very ugly numbers in the rest of the world.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Here* | Nov/1 | Sony | $4,875,195 | $12,227,851 | $13,295,076 | $50M

- Wake up babe, new Zemeckis flop just dropped. After barely one month in theaters, Sony/Miramax's ***Here*** has closed with just $12 million domestically and $13 million worldwide. Despite touting the film as a ***Forrest Gump*** reunion (Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright), the audience was uninterested. In fact, the domestic total is barely half of what ***Forrest Gump*** earned on its opening weekend back in 1994, and that's not even adjusted. Oh, Robert Zemeckis, what happened to you? To say that his glory days have passed...

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Five films, two of which are hitting wide release. But none stand a chance in topping the box office.

The first is Sony's latest addition in the Spider-Manless Spider-Man Universe, ***Kraven the Hunter***. This universe has been mostly profitable, but it carries an asterisk. The three ***Venom*** films are hits, while the other two (***Morbius*** and ***Madame Web***) flopped and became Internet's laughingstock. ***Kraven*** is leaning towards the latter. And for reasons beyond understand, Sony decided that this film warranted $130 million, making it their most expensive SSU film. After this, who knows what'll happen.

The other wide release is Warner Bros.'s ***The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim***, an anime prequel to Peter Jackson's trilogy. This franchise is one of the most powerful in film history... yet ***The War of the Rohirrim*** is not gonna come close anywhere close to that. Anime has a ceilling at the box office, and the pre-sales are insanely low. With a low screen count, limited marketing, and middling reviews so far, we'll see how low it can go.

Paramount is releasing ***September 5*** in limited release, before its wide release on January 17. The film recounts the 1972 Munich Olympic hostage crisis from the perspective of the ABC Sports crew and their coverage of the events. The film has received some solid reviews so far.

Amazon MGM is releasing ***Nickel Boys*** in limited release. The story follows two African American boys, Elwood and Turner, who are sent to an abusive reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida. The film has received critical acclaim, and there's Oscar buzz on the horizon. Watch out for this one.

The other one is Gia Coppola's ***The Last Showgirl***, starring Pamela Anderson. Reviews are very positive, with Anderson lauded for a career-best performance.

movies,Actors/Actresses who screwed up a comeback arc?,"Everyone loves a good comeback story. From sports to music and especially movies. Robert Downey Jr., Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, Drew Barrymore, and soon probably Demi Moore and Pamela Anderson. However, what are some expectations to the rule that you know of off the top of your head?

First one that comes to mind for me is Mickey Rourke. His acting prowess and sex-symbol status made him a promising star in the 80s. Was a notorious asshole on set who insulted producers and pretty much made things difficult for everyone. Took up boxing (which he sucked at) when his career derailed in the 90s, leaving him with tons of facial injuries that Mickey insisted on fixing with terrible plastic surgery. Then in the 2000s, Sin City and The Wrestler (the latter of which he was nominated for an Oscar for) brought him back for a while, until he later ended up doing exactly what he did before. Being an asshole to everyone on the sets of his features, taking up boxing again when his career derailed, and fuck his face up even more.

Another example I could think of is Cuba Gooding Jr.. Had a breakout role in Boyz in the Hood, won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire, then began starring in a bunch shitty comedy movies in the 2000s. Tried to redeem himself with that People vs. O.J. show, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance, until that halted when he was hit with various sexual harassment lawsuits, and now the last time I saw him recently was when he promoting some low-budget Christian movie with Kevin Sorbo.",RockyPS2Glitches,1hauuix,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hauuix/actorsactresses_who_screwed_up_a_comeback_arc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hauuix/actorsactresses_who_screwed_up_a_comeback_arc/,2024-12-10 05:39:13,375,0.89,375,0,301,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hauuix

&gt;Although not hitting us emotionally on the scale of the live action films, Kamiyama has produced a visual landscape that at times , through use of motion capture, models, and hand drawn animation do register a striking visual motif, not what we have previously associated with the cinematic efforts at Tolkein, but a world of its own merged with more allegiance to Jackson than Tolkein.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236243179/) (60):

&gt;For those who can’t get enough of Middle Earth, here’s two-plus hours of deep-cut backstory to feed your appetite, centered around a siege at the stronghold that would come to be known as Helm’s Deep (where we saw Saruman’s Orcs obliterated by Ents in “The Two Towers”).

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (80):

&gt;Fans are sure to appreciate the call-outs and references to the earlier movies, including sections incorporating composer Howard Shore’s original themes and a late shout-out to Gandalf. But those not familiar with Tolkien minutiae will still be able to enjoy *The War of the Rohirrim* on its own visually grand, mythic storytelling terms, even if it does eventually seem overlong at 134 minutes (brief by comparison to the live-action entries, but still).

[IndieWire](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review-1236075681/) (C-):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” is a paper-thin prequel that stretches a single page of Tolkien’s appendices into a 134-minute story of how the fortress of Helm’s Deep got its name (spoiler alert: it was named after a guy named Helm), I suppose we should be grateful that this limp and cheap-looking epic is bad in a few different ways than we’ve come to expect? At least it *aspires* to mine a fresh experience from the all too familiar tedium of watching Hollywood pick a franchise dry, even if it ultimately falls well short of that goal.

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/492608/war-of-the-rohirrim-movie-review-peter-jackson) (80):

&gt;This attention to detail and reproduction is the movie’s greatest strength — The War of the Rohirrim looks and feels like Jackson’s LotR in the best way. It’s packed full of sword-swinging adventure, kingly drama and riveting monster mayhem. Unfortunately, it also reproduces the aspect of the Jackson movies that has aged most poorly.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (50):

&gt;What could have been an exciting experiment in telling a new tale in a beloved universe in a very different way feels heavily compromised. Kenji Kamiyama and his fellow anime veterans have produced great work before, but this uninspired expansion of the most iconic screen take on Tolkien doesn't allow anyone to show off what they can do best.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1730142/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;If this is just the first of many spin-offs to come, we can only hope future efforts learn all the right lessons from ""The War of the Rohirrim."" So where does the franchise go from here? All I know is that it'd be a shame to let the riskiest ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie in years scare us right back to safer shores.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/):

&gt;“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” plays like a straight-to-video rush job that got a little out of hand, and now it has to play to a theatrical crowd that’s unlikely to forgive its many haphazard flaws. It’s hard to get mad at this movie, but it’s oh so easy to be disappointed.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim/) (3/5):

&gt;It never scrapes the heights of Jackson’s trilogy — few do — but amid a messy meeting of worlds, there are stirring moments.

[Collider](https://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review/) (6/10):

&gt;The animated trip to Middle-earth is an unexpected journey, but its subpar story and underdeveloped characters make it difficult to revisit there and back again.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-review) (6/10):

&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is a fascinating idea with a lackluster execution, more interesting as a concept than an actual retelling of one of Middle-earth’s famous legends.

Directed by Kenji Kamiyama

&gt;Set 183 years before the events of the Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), *The War of the Rohirrim* tells the story of Helm Hammerhand, a legendary king of Rohan, and his family as they defend their kingdom against an army of Dunlendings. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the stronghold Helm's Deep.

movies,Revisiting the Transformers Movies – The VFX Quality Drop After the First Few!,"I recently rewatched the *Transformers* series, and I was blown away by the VFX in the first two movies (*Transformers* 2007 and *Revenge of the Fallen* 2009). The realism and detail in the transformations were ahead of their time.

But as I’m watching *Age of Extinction*, some of the shots with Transformers and humans together just feel... cheaper. The VFX doesn't seem as polished or seamless as in the earlier films. It almost looks like a video game cutscene at times, which feels disappointing compared to what they accomplished before.

Anyone else notice this drop in quality?",AnteaterMysterious83,1har9z2,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1har9z2/revisiting_the_transformers_movies_the_vfx/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1har9z2/revisiting_the_transformers_movies_the_vfx/,2024-12-10 02:23:25,0,0.2,0,0,7,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1har9z2
