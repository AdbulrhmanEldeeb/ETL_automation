books,Do you fall into a reading slump at certain times of the year? ,"
I always seem to fall into a reading slump this time of year. Some years, I manage to read a few books before I just can’t stand reading anymore. Other years, I did not read a single book in the month of December. 

My guess is that it’s the end of the year and I’m burnt out from all the reading I’ve done. I also tend to fall into a big reading slump in either June or July, the halfway point of the year where I’m overwhelmed with all the books I still “need” to read. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you fall into slumps randomly or do they happen at specific points in the year?

books,Reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac made very nostalgic for a time I never lived in ,"Disclaimer: I know, like most books in its vein, On the Road was sensationalized to a degree. I also understand that the Beat Generation was countercultural and Kerouac’s writings do not represent the general views of people of the 1950s. 

That being said, as a Gen-Z guy who recently finished this book, I was really struck by how unusual so many of the formative, chaotic experiences portrayed in this story would be in the America of today. On an obvious level, hitchhiking and carpooling with random people cross country are largely a thing of the past. I also found the characters rolling into random towns and instantly getting informal work as unrealistic. I mean, these days you have to submit an online resume for Walmart, and they’re also gonna run a background check, which would have severely hampered Dean’s employment opportunities. People also just take fewer chances now. Statistically, our generation uses way less drugs, has way less sex, and is a lot more cynical than the On the Road crew. 

But also on a deeper level, it feels like there’s a huge difference between what “finding yourself” involves now and what it involved then. Maybe more than in the late 40s and early 50s, people are expected to take their 20s to find themselves today. But you don’t really get lost anymore. People usually study abroad or see Europe through a tour company. If they go to Africa, it’s through a safari; Mexico is through a resort package. Even Mount Everest has somehow been commodified. And of course, for all of those trips you’ll be in constant contact with the outside world, have directions to everything on your smartphone, and be cataloguing the whole thing on social media. How many people are camping in the middle of the Mexican jungle on the roof of their car, as Dean and Sal did? Moreover, in contrast to the live  jazz clubs where Dean acted like an absolute madman, you’ll be paying $20+ covers to get in today’s clubs for the opportunity to stand around and take pictures of the light show while listening to remixes of 20 year old music. It’s like when the majority of people start to see young adulthood as a time of impulsive hedonism and self discovery, a framework for how that hedonism and self discovery is supposed to be done starts to emerge, and the whole thing feels a lot less adventurous. It becomes scheduled, ordered, and expensive—sometimes done more for others than yourself. Maybe adventure is still there, but it’s certainly way less messy. 

And I guess in more concrete terms, that’s what On the Road makes me nostalgic for: a time before we’d set out to remove all the messiness from life. In Kerouac’s day you could bounce around the West for a few years without having to worry so much about how the gap on your resume would look to employers. You could earn fine money living in the Dakotas and hitching rides to work on the harvests. People weren’t always connected; they couldn’t just Google how places looked, and when they went out on an adventure, it felt like they were really going into the unknown. Paradoxically, it feels like in a time that is seen as much more socially restrained, life could be much freer. 

The message I took out of On the Road was that, ultimately, the chaos of youth gives way to adult responsibilities. But, that doesn’t make the chaos pointless, unfulfilling, or wrong. It’s really a necessary step in development that challenges your preconceptions, puts your life in perspective, and gives you a concept of something beyond yourself before you do surrender to responsibility. I see the diminishment of this developmental phase and the commodification of chaos and adventure today as being a very unfortunate thing. Of course, Dean’s philosophy had major drawbacks (his general sexism and willingness to abandon women read pretty badly today), but I think the general point stands: adventure isn’t the same now as it was then. 

I would be interested in how others read the “beat” writers today, or, if any of you are of that generation, if you see this analysis as true. I think overall, while this book was definitely a product of its time, I found it to be very thought provoking and enjoyable, largely because of how well it captured spontaneous youthful exuberance and the atmosphere of the era.

books,Found one book lice: should I be freaking out?,"I buy mostly used books. I found what I think is a book lice in one of my new acquisitions. I skimmed through the book as well as a few others in the pile and haven’t found any more. I’m only just learning about them and I’m not sure how worried I should be. I’m reading that they thrive in heat and humidity and it’s the time of year where the house is kept colder and it’s naturally pretty dry.

I’ll probably freeze the book I found it in for a few days, but it was in a pile with 5 or 6 others and in close proximity (2-3 feet) to another 10 or so and 5 feet away from another 15+. It’d be quite a trek for such little guys though. I’ve only had this book for about 2 weeks.

books,Your Favourite Book Title(s) &amp; Its Significance or Insignificance to the Story,"What is your favourite, or some of your favourite book titles, and what is its significance or insignificance? Is the title directly quoted, or does the title not get quoted directly and is more thematic?



For me, it's *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin. The title of the book is what pulled me in. It's directly quoted in the book as ""Light is the left hand of darkness, and darkness the right hand of light"". Its referring to the age old thought that light and dark need to exist together and you can't have one without the other. Its not just a reference to the duality of light and dark, but to others as well such as gender and class structure, and how these things are not so black and white.",Jeranda,1hadvd9,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hadvd9/your_favourite_book_titles_its_significance_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hadvd9/your_favourite_book_titles_its_significance_or/,2024-12-09 16:38:29,49,0.93,49,0,61,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1hadvd9
