webdev,I made a new programming language to simplify web development - would love your feedback!,"Hey everyone! üëã

I wanted to share a project I'm really excited about - a new programming language called BuckshotPlusPlus that aims to make web development more intuitive.  
Here's how a simple component looks:

    view button {
        type = ""button""
        content = ""Click me!""
        background-color = ""#007bff""
        color = ""white""
        padding = ""10px 20px""
    }

  
The language includes built-in session handling, data caching, and component management. I'm working on video tutorials on [youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0k22uoR9Bc&amp;list=PLttkrjVo_pZoPMCZgw_ByK6Y9Yb_r--oA&amp;index=3)to help people get started , and I'd love your input on what topics to cover!  
The project is open source: [https://github.com/BuckshotPlusPlus/BuckshotPlusPlus](https://github.com/BuckshotPlusPlus/BuckshotPlusPlus)

  
I'm actively working on improving it and would love to hear your thoughts on what would make this truly useful for your web development needs. Feel free to share your ideas or ask any questions!

webdev,"First Month Update - $6K in revenue, here is what I learned","Hey fellow web developers,

Hope you‚Äôre all doing amazing! I wanted to share a bit about what the past month has been like for me.

I'm pretty sure you are all familiar with my product - ChatGPT Toolbox, I posted about it here before, But in case you missed it, it‚Äôs a Chrome extension designed to supercharge your ChatGPT experience. It bridges all the gaps and adds tons of useful features, like creating folders, pinning chats, saving and reusing prompts, exporting conversations, and even downloading messages as MP3 files with 9 different voice options. And that‚Äôs just scratching the surface‚Äîthere are plenty more cool tools packed in!

you can read more about it here:

www.ai-toolbox.co

 Last Saturday marks a full month since my extension officially became a paid product, and wow, what a ride it‚Äôs been. It‚Äôs been a month packed with lessons, challenges, and a few wins that I‚Äôm really proud of. To celebrate hitting 5,500 users and $6,000 in revenue in just the first month, I wanted to share 5 big lessons I‚Äôve learned along the way.

1Ô∏è‚É£ A great product isn‚Äôt enough.
This one hit me hard. You can have the most amazing product ever, but if you can‚Äôt clearly explain its value to people, it‚Äôs not going anywhere. I had to work on really understanding what my audience needed and how to communicate that effectively.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing isn‚Äôt optional.
Honestly, I thought the product would ""sell itself"" at first. Big mistake. Even if it‚Äôs great, no one will buy it if they don‚Äôt know it exists. Marketing has been a steep learning curve for me, but I‚Äôve realized just how critical it is to make some noise about your product.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer support = magic.
I answered 97% of customer emails within 3 minutes (the other 3%? I was asleep üòÖ). People were blown away by the quick responses. If email didn‚Äôt solve their issue, I jumped on a Google Meet with them. The reaction was always the same: pure shock and gratitude. Those moments reminded me how much a little extra effort can make a huge difference.

4Ô∏è‚É£ I shine in live interactions, not on social media.
I was invited to present my extension in front of 700 people during a webinar, and it was such a rush. People loved it, and the feedback I got afterward was unreal.

What stood out to me, though, was that I connect much better with people live than through social media. Whenever I try posting videos or updates, they don‚Äôt seem to land the same way. But when I‚Äôm live? That‚Äôs where I thrive. Definitely something I‚Äôll need to figure out moving forward.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Organic growth is the real MVP.
Every single user so far has come from organic traffic. I hired a marketing agency to help scale, but honestly, they haven‚Äôt brought in even one new customer yet. It‚Äôs frustrating, but I‚Äôm staying patient.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been focusing on rolling out cool new features. I have about 70,000 ideas buzzing in my head ü§Ø, and this month, I pushed out updates like crazy. I just ran a quick poll in my community, and the top-voted feature was live within 24 hours. That was such a fun win!

So, what‚Äôs next?
I‚Äôve realized that for my next product, I really need to build a personal brand to make this process easier. But that‚Äôs easier said than done‚Äîwhat language do I use? what platform? Still trying to figure that out.

It‚Äôs been a wild month, and I feel like things are just getting started. Would love to hear your thoughts or any questions you might have‚Äîlet‚Äôs chat in the comments!",john2219,1hajki5,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hajki5/first_month_update_6k_in_revenue_here_is_what_i/,https://i.redd.it/b0pvquu0vv5e1.jpeg,2024-12-09 20:31:19,0,0.31,0,0,19,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LWDKOp2yHZwvPqsU1WOu3fV02h1UddWyO9Xf1nEQMZM.jpg,t3_1hajki5

webdev,Ecommerce choice for almost 500k monthly visitors?,"Hey, I am currently in process of building a rather heavy ecommerce that will have a lot of features ( including all normal ecommerce features such as shipping, stock management, order status types, user registration, loyalty features etc). And I will likely need something really strong and customizable, I will also need something that I can go headless route which will allow me to decouple front from back.

Shipping and order management should be something I can fully customize though (like offer free shipping after a certain amount, set order status to what shipping method is used).

There will also be recurring payments, which will be monthly, bi weekly or weekly depending on user package (they will be just a small part of the shop though, I can set the recurring payments via stripe or paypal if needed).

Shop will be operating in Europe and will likely end up being a multi store type shop (different for every country it will operate in, not many countries max 4).

So far I have checked out Shopify Plus, Shopware 6, Medusajs etc.

Shopify Plus while good doesn't really seem to fit the criteria for my project considering client doesn't want to pay monthly for addons and such so I've ruled it out. 

I did look at Medusajs but to be honest it seems like it lacks so many features out of box that most shops have, it lacks category nesting (based on what I have seen) which is something I really need to have.

Shopware 6 to me seems like a good choice, since it is customizable enough for it to work for me and headless seems like a good enough option for it. 

I have ruled out some things like Woocommerce (too slow and can't rely on its security), Magento 2 (too much dev time) and PrestaShop.

My question is, is there anything better and faster considering project scope than Shopware 6? 

Thank you very much for reading.

webdev,"Warning, Smartrmail app contains 'bad' automatic permissions in the terms &amp; conditions, and will plant your business's email in everyones' spam.","I recently made a giant mistake by downloading this one Shopify add-on app... right from that wholesome official Shopify app store.

I recently decided to try out this marketing app, Smartrmail (bad idea). I have to say... the experience was so negative, that I felt the need to protect fellow store owners.

Once you download the app, you'll notice the option to create a password for your account (recommended by the app for ""security purposes"" lol). Once you create a password, you'll never be able to delete your account or change the email attached. Not kidding.

The option to delete your account isn't available. You cannot remove your important business-email from this account profile. The option isn't available. You will be stuck.

Next, they'll start sending shitty emails from a shitty template from your email address, because you agreed to 'let' them by checking the box that says ""I agree to these terms and conditions."" They will send emails to every single one of your customers, and the emails look TERRIBLE.

This is so heinous, I had to dig deeper. The company was active about three years ago in late 2020, and then closed it's doors. The application business, Smartrmail, was acquired in 2023 by new owners. At the bottom of the page, the app claims to be owned by Intercom (Google showed it as an AI chat bot business for retail), however, there isn't any proof anywhere else on the web that shady ass Smartrmail is ACTUALLY owned by Intercom. The Shopify app store says it's owned by a company called Relay. So, who is who? We just don't know yet.

Worse, this app has received 500+ 5 star reviews... yet their official youtube channel has less than 100 views total for the three half-ass AI videos they have up. All of them use AI voices. Why on earth wouldn't anybody want their actual name/face or voice affiliated with Smartrmail. Is there something wrong with it? I'm still seriously considering calling the US &amp; Australian FBI, this app is sooooo effing shady. It blows my mind the Shopify app store approved it... yikes

I care about this community, so that's why I'm recommending you stay away from this super-scam Smartrmail app on Shopify. You deserve better. We all do. I love Shopify as much as the rest of us. I can't believe Shopify is letting this app continue... so embarrassing for them.

Don't believe me? Log-out, and open a separate, free 30-day Shopify trial using a dummy email address, and see for yourself. You'll see what I'm talking about. This app is designed to hurt sellers.

webdev,Is Programmatic Review Flagging Possible via Google API?,"Hi,

I work for a marketing company that manages multiple businesses, and one of my responsibilities is flagging Google reviews that breach Google's policies and following up with Google based on the outcome.

The main challenge is that this is a manual process‚Äîwe have to log in to each client account and perform this task individually. I‚Äôve noticed that some other platforms offer a dashboard where users can flag specific reviews and receive feedback on Google‚Äôs response regarding those reviews. If Google‚Äôs reply is negative, these platforms allow users to provide additional information through the same dashboard to support their reason for flagging the review.

I know this process can be done manually via a business‚Äôs Google My Business (GMB) account and the Google Reviews Management Tool to submit more information for a review. However, I‚Äôve searched extensively and can‚Äôt find any information in the Google API that would enable the above scenario programmatically.

This makes me wonder if these other companies are falsely marketing their dashboards and actually have someone manually performing the process in the background, while simply updating the dashboard with Google‚Äôs feedback.",startup4you,1haol26,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haol26/is_programmatic_review_flagging_possible_via/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haol26/is_programmatic_review_flagging_possible_via/,2024-12-10 00:10:21,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haol26

webdev,Launched an Open Source Tool on Product Hunt. Want to share why I built it.,"Over the past year of building AI-enabled SaaS applications, I kept hitting the same wall. Going from a Jupyter notebook full of AI RAG techniques to something usable in my app was a nightmare. I'm sure if anyone here has taking a look at llama-index or langchain cookbook sections you might understand what I'm talking about.  
  
I came to the conclusion that this is the problem:  
\- Notebooks are great for testing ideas, but they‚Äôre not meant for building applications around them.  
\- I had to manually dissect notebooks, build a proof-of-concept API server, integrate it into my app, and pray it worked.  
\- The feedback loop was \*painfully\* long‚Äîand most of the time, I canned the project because it didn‚Äôt quite fit.  
  
This frustration comes from a gap in roles:  
1. Data Scientists/AI Devs want notebooks to experiment with methods and techniques‚Äîbut it's not their main focus to also create an API for other applications to use.  
2. App Developers just want simple APIs to test and integrate quickly to see if it actually enhances their app.

This is where KitchenAI comes in. A tool that bridges this gap by transforming your AI Jupyter notebooks into production-ready API server in minutes.  
  
But why??  
\- Shorter Development Cycles  
Test, iterate, and deploy AI techniques faster and cut the feedback loop in half.  
\- Vendor and Framework Agnostic  
Use the libraries you‚Äôre comfortable with, no lock-ins.  
\- Plugin Architecture  
Extend functionality with plugins for evaluation frameworks, observability, prompt management, and more.  
\- Open Source and Local-First  
Built on trusted technologies like Django, so you stay in control‚Äîno 3rd-party dependencies required.  
\- Docker-Ready  
Share your API server as a lightweight container for easy collaboration.  
  
We‚Äôve released KitchenAI as an Apache-licensed open-source tool, so anyone can use it. Up next is a managed cloud version with deeper integrations, metrics, analytics, and workflows for teams with more complex needs. One short term goal is to go straight from colab to a KitchenAI cloud hosted API so development can be absolutely seamless.

- Boost your proposals and stand out from competition to get more clients on autopilot
- Provide clients with automated communication and updates on the project at any time.
- Ensure absolute client satisfaction for long-term opportunites and more dollars.

webdev,Is it possible to repeatedly click a static button to show social media videos?,"[https://CaneFreestyle.com](https://CaneFreestyle.com) allows users to click the home page and see cane videos randomly.

PROBLEM:

The user clicks the home page, watches a random link, and must navigate back to the home page.

Sites like Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube pages contain have Javascript that breaks frames.

They also detect if their page is embedded in frames and prevent their page from displaying.

Worse, if the mobile apps are installed, the user is redirected to see the link in the app.

SOLUTION:

I would like to change the website so that:

1. he user can click a button that does not move
2. the user can click the button repeatedly
3. each time they click, they see a random video
4. the site avoids violating the terms of services
5. it works using frontend Javascript, HTML, &amp; CSS

It will be nicer if the user can simply ***click one button repeatedly*** and see random links.

Is there a way to make it so that the user can watch 100 videos only by clicking 100 times?",DealDeveloper,1haqsp0,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haqsp0/is_it_possible_to_repeatedly_click_a_static/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haqsp0/is_it_possible_to_repeatedly_click_a_static/,2024-12-10 01:58:56,0,0.17,0,0,3,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,t3_1haqsp0

webdev,"High-level architecture of my point-of-sales app (Vue, IndexedDB, Electron &amp; React Native + Laravel)","I've been building a point-of-sales app that works on iPads, Android devices and Windows systems, and I drew up a high-level architecture diagram to show you.

At the core sits a Vue SPA, that gets wrapped in:

* Electron for Windows/MacOS builds
* React Native for Android and iOS builds

[High-level architecture of our POS app](https://preview.redd.it/n3s58yejau5e1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6912edbafd36ace6bfe35d1c68efeb39de887fbf)

Both the React Native app, and the Electron app have a shared NodeJS component, that allows the SPA to communicate with devices on the network using TCP for example.

This way, our app can communicate with peripherals like thermal printers and payment terminals.

Since React Native doesn't come with a NodeJS runtime, we ship [NodeJS mobile](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/) with it, and this entire setup allows me to share \~95% of my entire codebase for all platforms.

I'm curious about your experiences with the current cross-platform SDKs","Disclaimer: I intend to build POC apps in my short list to come to my own conclusion, but I would like your opinions in case i've over looked something.

I've always had a native-firsts stance, so I haven't needed a cross-platform solution for a while so i am a bit out of date on the current state of affairs, so i'd like any constructive feedback

I'm currently considering:

- flutter
- kotlin compose/native
- nativescript

My thoughts so far:

**Flutter**

Pros: 

- I've always loved flutter from the pre-beta version
- Their rendering model is very interesting
- Dart is perfectly boring in the best sense of the way. It is familiar whether you're coming from java, javascript, or some other algol-inspired language. it can be quickly adopted by other developers in an afternoon or so
- It is a very opinionated language which eliminates unnecessary conversations about how to do things
- Their web output is finally stable


Cons: 

- State management and design patterns have been questionable in the past and change often. 
- Using canvas for the web output feels icky but that's a knee-jerk reaction and they seem to have addressed accessibility issues

**kotlin**

Pros: 

- Jetbrains understands developer needs and have vastly improved the android ecosystem. 
- Kotlin fixes java and is a fun language

Cons: 

- Kotlin has a large learning curve for new devs because there are so many features. 
- Web and iOS are not yet to a stable state

**nativescript**

Pros:

- It seems robust and stable
- It supports many FE tools

Cons:

- I have no experience with it


**Things i've ruled out (but can be convinced otherwise)**

- react native
- ionic
- anything that uses a web view",anus-the-legend,1haogom,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haogom/yacpd_question_i_know_this_has_been_asked_many/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1haogom/yacpd_question_i_know_this_has_been_asked_many/,2024-12-10 00:04:27,1,1.0,1,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Discussion,self,t3_1haogom
webdev,Can somebody help? Node.js and PSQL,"My front end works fine, but this exact part about updating a client's info is getting over my head and I really need some guidance. I hope some life saver could help. 

This is my clients table on my DB:

      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      birth_date DATE,

      email VARCHAR(255),
      address TEXT,
      license VARCHAR(50),
      license_expiry DATE,
      note TEXT
    );

And I have this controller for updating a client's info: 

    const updateClient = async (req, res) =&gt; {
      const id = req.params.id_number;
    
      const { name, birth_date, id_document, id_expiry, phone, email, address, license, license_expiry, note } = req.body;
    
      const responseReturn = new ResponseClass();
    
      const query = `UPDATE clients SET name = $1, birth_date = $2, id_document = $3, id_expiry = $4, phone = $5, email = $6, address = $7, license = $8, license_expiry = $9, note = $10 WHERE id_number = $11`;
    
      const params = [name, birth_date, id_document, id_expiry, phone, email, address, license, license_expiry, note, id];
    
      try {
        const { rows } = await queryDatabase(query, params);
        if (rows.length === 0) {
          responseReturn.status = false;
          responseReturn.code = 404;
          responseReturn.message = ""Client not found"";
          return res.status(404).json(responseReturn);
        }
    
        responseReturn.status = true;
        responseReturn.code = 200;
        responseReturn.message = ""Client updated successfully"";
        res.status(200).json(responseReturn);
      }
    
     catch (error) {
        responseReturn.status = false;
        responseReturn.code = 500;
        responseReturn.message = ""Error updating client"";
        responseReturn.data = error.message;
        res.status(500).json(responseReturn);
      }
    };

I also have the other CRUD functions and they are working perfectly, but when it comes to updating a client and clicking the modify button, A server error 500 keeps logging on my console and nothing is updated. 

This is how I'm handling the form submit: 

    const handleSubmit = async (e) =&gt; {
        e.preventDefault();
    
        console.log(formData);
    
        try {
          const response = await fetch(""http://localhost:8080/api/clients"", {
            method: ""POST"",
            headers: {
              ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(formData),
          });
    
          const data = await response.json();
    
          if (response.ok) {
            MessageToast(data.message);
            onSubmit(formData);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
        }
      };

webdev,I Built a WordPress Plugin to Solve My Own Problem‚ÄîLooking for Feedback on How to Share It ,"Hey Reddit!

I‚Äôve recently built a WordPress plugin, and I‚Äôm at the stage where I could really use your advice on how to productize and share it with others.

Here‚Äôs the backstory: I was developing a WordPress plugin, and every time I made a small change, I had to:  
1Ô∏è Zip the folder  
2Ô∏è Upload it to WordPress  
3Ô∏è Install it  
4Ô∏è Activate it  
5Ô∏è Test

And I was doing this *every 2-3 minutes.*

Coming from modern frameworks like Vue, where **hot reloads** are standard, this felt painfully outdated. So, I decided to create something that would let me just push my changes to GitHub and have it automatically sync and deploy.

That‚Äôs how **RepoSync** was born‚Äîa plugin that simplifies WordPress development workflows. It‚Äôs functional and ready to go! Here‚Äôs what it does:

* **Auto-syncs with GitHub** so you can skip the zip-upload madness. Just push ti Github and your plugin will be updated automatically
* Supports **private repos**, even on the free tier
* Lets you connect to **specific branches**
* Keeps the setup super simple so anyone can use it (no setting up web hooks, just a simple oauth approval with read permissions)

There are other tools on the market, but I found them either missing key features (like auto-sync or private repo support), were too tedious to set up, or too expensive for what they offer.

**Here‚Äôs where I need your help:**

* **How should I productize it?** I‚Äôm considering a **generous free tier** (maybe limiting to 1-2 plugins/themes but including private repos) and offering both **recurring and one-time payment options**. Most of the others only have a subscription which I hate. I'd rather pay a one-time fee.
* **What‚Äôs the best way to share it with the community?** Should I go all in on the WordPress marketplace, or are there other avenues I should explore?

I‚Äôm also looking for **beta testers**, so if this sounds like something you‚Äôd use, let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy to share the full version with you for free.

webdev,Questions about interfacing with OAuth and Azure,"Hey all! Will be posting this to an Azure subreddit too, but since half of the problem is mine as a dev, thought somebody here might be able to help...

For the past 3 years, have been providing single sign-on to a site I run for a client who uses Azure for their employee logins. That was a big learning curve for me as a dev (first work with Azure SSO), but it's been going great since. The expiry for the original certificates is coming up quickly, though, and the closer we get the more I feel like rollover is a situation of ""the blind leading the blind"". Hoping somebody here might have experience from the admin and developer side and be able to provide some perspective.

My understanding is that the usual rollover goes like this... They add a new cert with a later expiry, and add it as a secondary in Azure. They send it my way (they sent it in an XML document). When I'm set, I swap out the old cert for the new, things for the site continue unabated, and once everything's stable they can make the new cert primary and delete the old.

It appears that on their end they've only got ""active/inactive"" for certs, though. They're saying that I can't use the new cert while it's inactive, and activating the new one will deactivate the current one. Apparently they usually do the switch with a scheduled, simultaneous change on both ends. That sounds nuts to me.

So, first question is am I missing something here? I'd be happy to support their system by keeping a primary and fallback cert on my end, and trying the fallback if the primary fails, but in that case could use a little guidance on what going to a fallback looks like for OAuth (in particular, how to deal with the fact that trying the primary I believe consumes the authorization code). Any resources would be greatly appreciated.

Second question... When we started this whole thing the admin on their end had me send a PFX including the certificate for the key we're signing the client assertion with. That will also be expiring soon, so I assumed I'd need to get a new cert to them as well. They're saying there's no ""spot"" for that and they don't think they need an updated certificate. Can that be right?",base736,1hak8ue,https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hak8ue/questions_about_interfacing_with_oauth_and_azure/,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1hak8ue/questions_about_interfacing_with_oauth_and_azure/,2024-12-09 21:00:06,1,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Question,self,t3_1hak8ue
webdev,"Stream Postgres changes to AWS SQS, GCP Pub/Sub in real-time","Hey all,

We just added AWS SQS and GCP Pub/Sub support to Sequin. I'm a big fan of both systems so I'm very excited about this release. Check out the quickstarts here:

* [https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/sqs](https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/sqs)
* [https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/gcp-pubsub](https://sequinstream.com/docs/quickstart/gcp-pubsub)

**What is Sequin?**

Sequin is an open source tool for change data capture (CDC) in Postgres. Sequin makes it easy to stream Postgres rows and changes to streaming platforms and queues (e.g. SQS, Pub/Sub, Kafka):

[https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin)

**Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub**

So, you can backfill all or part of a Postgres table into SQS or Pub/Sub. Then, as inserts, updates, and deletes happen, Sequin will send those changes as JSON messages to your SQS queue or Pub/Sub topic in real-time.

**FIFO consumption**

We have full support for FIFO/ordered consumption. By default, we group/order messages by the source row's primary key (so if \`order\` \`id=1\` changes 3 times, all 3 change events will be strictly ordered). This means your downstream systems can know they're processing Postgres events in order.

For SQS FIFO queues, that means setting `MessageGroupId`. For Pub/Sub, that means setting the `orderingKey`.

You can set the `MessageGroupId`/`orderingKey` to any combination of the source row's fields.

**What can you build with Sequin + SQS or Pub/Sub?**

* **Event-driven workflows**: For example, triggering side effects when an order is fulfilled or a subscription is canceled.
* **Replication**: You have a change happening in Service A, and want to fan that change out to Service B, C, etc. Or want to replicate the data into another database or cache.
* **Kafka alt:** One thing I'm really excited about is that if you combine a Postgres table with SQS or Pub/Sub via Sequin, you have a system that's comparable to Kafka. Your Postgres table can hold historical messages/records. When you bring a new service online (in Kafka parlance, consumer group) you can use Sequin to backfill all the historical messages into that service's SQS queue or Pub/Sub Topic. So it makes these systems behave more like a stream, and you get to use Postgres as the retention layer.

**Example**

You can setup a Sequin sink easily with [sequin.yaml](https://sequinstream.com/docs/reference/sequin-yaml#sequin-yaml) (a lightweight Terraform ‚Äì Terraform support coming soon!)

Here's an example of an SQS sink:

    # sequin.yaml
    databases:
      - name: ""my-postgres""
        hostname: ""your-rds-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com""
        database: ""app_production""
        username: ""postgres""
        password: ""your-password""
        slot_name: ""sequin_slot""
        publication_name: ""sequin_pub""
        tables:
          - table_name: ""orders""
            sort_column_name: ""updated_at""
    
    sinks:
      - name: ""orders-to-sqs""
        database: ""my-postgres""
        table: ""orders""
        batch_size: 1
        # Use order_id for FIFO message grouping
        group_column_names: [""id""]
        # Optional: only stream fulfilled orders
        filters:
          - column_name: ""status""
            operator: ""=""
            comparison_value: ""fulfilled""
        destination:
          type: ""sqs""
          queue_url: ""https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/orders-queue.fifo""
          access_key_id: ""AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
          secret_access_key: ""your-secret-key""

webdev,Resources to learn about images,"Greetings, 

After just making a super basic SPA I found working regards to images to be quite frustrating. I am familiar with the myriad of devices and screen sizes that need to be accommodated, but I am quite rusty. I am now thinking that for my portfolio I should start with a few websites that dont even have subjects in their images, but instead are just big colored X's that pertain to a certain image size so I can get the hang of this again. Thats practical right? I am rediscovering how switching from one content pane with images, to another with form inputs, will expand and contract the parent container and I need to revisit my understanding on this topic. 

On the other hand, I was also wondering if anyone knows of any resources or tutorials that do a deep focus on web development with respect to working with just images? It would be nice to learn more about how the web isnt all JPG, PNGs, SVGs, anymore, and whatever else has changed over the last 4 years since I have been in school. I did a search on this forums but I didnt find any resources that truly focused on this subject with great emphasis. 

Backstory- I used to manage a PHP/HTML/CSS/JQuery/WP website for a medium sized non-profit before COVID shutdown the company. I went back to school to earn a degree, landed a backend dev job, but then that company started hemorrhaging money and I am now seeking to go into Full Stack development by making a portfolio of projects using React/Node with BS5.

I've learnt how to use WordPress too now so the daily working of the websites was never an issue. The relative out of his own goodwill bought these and pays for them, however they are only for my small businesses and non profits

I have already informed him that I'll be taking over the hosting from him, and he has agreed to that.
